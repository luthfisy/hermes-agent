"""Model-assisted classification of flagged candidate snippets.

Stage two of the pipeline: takes the small set of snippets ``heuristics.py``
flagged, and asks a model to (a) confirm each one is really a durable
lesson and not noise, (b) write it as clean, plain-English rule text, (c)
assign a stable canonical key so paraphrased repeats collapse to the same
candidate, (d) judge whether it is global or tied to the one repo it
happened in, and (e) score confidence.

The call goes through the ``hermes`` command-line program
(``hermes chat -q ...``), never through a direct import of the hermes-agent
runtime — this pipeline has no dependency on that package (see the package
docstring). This also means the classification model call reuses Hermes'
already-configured credentials and provider routing with no new secret
handling in this codebase.

Toolset choice — read this before changing it
-----------------------------------------------
``hermes chat`` is an *agentic* CLI: whatever toolset it loads, the model
can call those tools mid-response. The text handed to this call is
untrusted (it came from a transcript, which may itself contain an attempted
prompt injection), so the toolset must be one that cannot mutate anything.
``-t session_search`` restricts the call to a single read-only tool (search
over Hermes' own session history) — it does not grant terminal, file-write,
memory, or skill-management access. An empty ``-t ""`` does NOT achieve
this: ``hermes chat`` treats an empty/omitted ``--toolsets`` as "use my
configured default toolset", which on a normal profile includes terminal
and file-write tools. ``session_search`` is deliberately chosen because it
is a real, validated toolset name (an unresolvable name risks falling
through to plugin/MCP discovery, which is slower and less predictable) that
carries no mutation capability of its own. Do not switch this to an
unvalidated string as a shortcut to "probably zero tools" — a validation
failure or unexpected fallback there would silently restore full agentic
capability. If a genuine zero-tool completion path is added to ``hermes``
in the future, prefer it over this toolset restriction.

Every failure mode here — the ``hermes`` binary missing, a timeout, a
non-zero exit, unparseable output, a response that fails schema validation
— degrades to "classify nothing this batch" rather than raising. A batch
that fails classification is not lost: its raw candidates simply are not
promoted to the candidate store this run, and the same transcript lines are
not re-scanned (the checkpoint already advanced), but the *heuristic*
signal will resurface on the next paraphrase or repeat occurrence in a
future session. Losing one batch's LLM polish is an acceptable trade for
never corrupting pipeline state on a bad model response.

Scope classification prefers the weaker generalization
--------------------------------------------------------
Choosing ``scope: "global"`` from one narrow observation is a generalization
problem: infer, from a single example, a rule meant to hold for every
future Claude Code session. Bennett, "The Optimal Choice of Hypothesis Is
the Weakest, Not the Shortest" (arXiv:2301.12987) and its corrigendum
"Optimal Policy Is Weakest Policy" show that the hypothesis most likely to
generalize correctly is not the shortest or most sweeping one consistent
with the evidence, but the *weakest* one — the one that claims the least
beyond what was actually observed. A short, unqualified rule such as
"Never use --no-verify" is a strong claim: it constrains every future
session in every repository. A rule scoped to the one script or repository
where it was actually said is weak: it constrains less, and is
correspondingly more likely to still be true once real evidence
distinguishes the cases where it applies from the cases where it does not.
The corrigendum adds one condition this pipeline cannot verify from a
single occurrence: that preference is *necessary* for optimal
generalization only when future contexts are not known in advance to
skew toward the broader claim. A lesson observed in one script, in one
repository, carries no such evidence. ``_looks_narrowly_scoped`` below is
the mechanical form of that preference: when the evidence names a specific
repository, script, file, or task, the classification is held to "repo"
scope even if the model answered "global" — the model is asked to prefer
the narrower scope too (see ``_build_prompt``), but this is enforced in
code because a prompt instruction cannot be tested against a real model in
this test suite, only a deterministic check can be.
