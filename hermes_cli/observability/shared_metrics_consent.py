"""Shared-metrics consent: one global answer, per-profile overrides, one writer.

Consent for anonymous usage metrics is a decision about the PERSON, not about a profile, so
the first answer given on any surface (onboarding checkbox, CLI/desktop prompt, wizard,
``hermes tools``, Settings) is recorded once at the Hermes root
(``<root>/telemetry-consent.json``) and inherited by every profile that has not set
``telemetry.shared_metrics.enabled`` itself. That is a deliberate, product-approved exception
to "profiles are independent islands" and applies ONLY to this consent. A profile's own
explicit ``enabled``/``send`` keys always win over the global answer, so any profile can opt
out (or in) locally afterwards.

Hosted / automated deployments have no person to ask, so ``HERMES_SHARED_METRICS`` in the
process environment supplies the instance-wide answer (``true`` = share, ``false`` = decline)
when no profile key and no recorded human answer exist. It sits BELOW both — a person's
recorded decision always beats the operator default — and it is read live, so it is not
persisted and stops applying when unset.

Every surface writes through ``apply_shared_metrics_choice``: it sets the profile keys
explicitly, records the global answer the first time, and reconciles the send-consent window
at the moment of the decision — the same writer the relay and the sender use, so no two
callers can disagree about when consent was observed.
