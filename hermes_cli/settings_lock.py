"""Operator settings lock: named config paths no writer may change until it is unlocked.

The lock is enforced at the seam where a ``config.yaml`` document is realised on disk, not in each
front door: the whole-document primitives — :func:`hermes_cli.config.atomic_config_write` and the
two ruamel round-trip writers :func:`utils.atomic_roundtrip_yaml_save` /
:func:`utils.atomic_roundtrip_yaml_update` — each call :func:`check_config_write` against the
document they are about to replace. ``save_config``, ``hermes config set``/``unset``, the TUI's and
the desktop's model switch, the desktop's ``config.set`` RPC, the web Config page, the gateway
slash commands, the credential lifecycle, the ``hermes auth`` provider switch, ``hermes agent
import`` and the post-update restore all end in one of those — and a writer added tomorrow is
covered by using any of them. Writers with an EARLIER side effect (a ``.env`` rotation, an
``auth.json`` switch) ask first so a refusal never leaves a half-applied change.


The spec is read from the SHARED ROOT ``config.yaml`` only, never the active profile's: a
per-profile copy must not be able to unlock its own profile, for the same reason
``bots.force_private`` is root-only.

What this does and does not defend against, stated plainly because it matters:

* It stops a UI, an RPC client, ``hermes config set``, and an agent calling any of those from
  changing a locked setting. That covers accidents, well-meaning changes, and an agent that
  reaches for the documented command.
* It is NOT a security boundary against anyone who can write ``config.yaml`` directly. They can
  edit the locked value, or delete the lock stanza, in one line. Back it with file ownership
  (run the gateway as a user that cannot write its own config) if that is the threat.

Unlike the fail-OPEN Bot Mode flags, an unusable spec fails CLOSED. A typo in a visibility flag
must never quietly remove a working teammate; a typo in a lock must never quietly stop protecting
what the operator asked to protect. Refusing writes is recoverable by editing the file, which
already requires the access the lock does not claim to stop.

So the stanza is parsed into exactly three states by :func:`lock_state`, and every decision reads
that instead of re-deriving "is it on?" from an ambient value:

* ``off`` — no stanza, or ``enabled`` is a recognised false spelling. Writes proceed.
* ``valid`` — ``enabled`` is a recognised true spelling, ``keys`` names at least one path, and a
  ``password``, if present, is a hash this build can actually verify.
* ``unusable`` — the operator asked for a lock this build cannot apply as written: an unrecognised
  ``enabled`` value, no usable ``keys``, a ``password`` that is not a supported hash, or a stanza
  that is not a mapping. Every guarded write is refused, **including while an unlock window is
  open**: a spec that cannot be normalised cannot be reasoned about, and a window opened against
  one cannot be shown to have authorised anything. Recovery is editing the root ``config.yaml``.

An unlock window is therefore authority over ONE lock generation, not over "the lock" in general.
The receipt carries a fingerprint of the exact normalised spec (patterns + password hash) it was
opened against, and lapses the moment that changes — so unlocking lock A and then replacing it with
lock B does not leave B unlocked with B's password never verified.
