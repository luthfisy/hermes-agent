"""Hermes-managed uv and Python runtime repair.

Hermes owns its own uv binary at ``$HERMES_HOME/uv/uv`` (or ``uv.exe`` on
Windows). Every code path that needs uv resolves it from that single private
location. If the binary is missing, ``ensure_uv()`` bootstraps it via the
official standalone installer. The private directory is never added to PATH,
so Hermes cannot shadow a user's uv in interactive shells.

Legacy installs that placed the managed uv at ``$HERMES_HOME/bin/uv`` (the
pre-isolation layout — bin is a persisted User PATH entry on Windows) are
migrated to the private location on first use.
The Python backing the install is shared by every Hermes profile because the checkout's ``venv``
is shared. Runtime repair therefore uses an install-scoped store under
``<checkout>/.hermes-runtime/python``. A vulnerable interpreter is never reinstalled in place: a
new immutable Python generation is provisioned and a relocatable sibling venv built and smoke-tested
from it. POSIX installs cut over with same-filesystem directory renames; Windows installs
atomically repoint the live venv's ``pyvenv.cfg`` at the new generation instead, because any
open handle under the venv (cwd, open file, sync client) makes Windows refuse the rename.

    is exactly what keeps Hermes from ever bumping a user's uv or writing
    user PATH/profile state.  Re-running the official standalone installer
    into the private dir is therefore the ONLY way to advance Hermes' own
    copy, and the only supported refresh path for unmanaged installs — this
    is it (called from ``update_managed_uv`` on a throttle, and from runtime
    repair when provisioning needs a newer catalog).

    Re-running also refreshes the embedded python-build-standalone download
    catalog, which otherwise stays frozen at bootstrap age:
    python-build-standalone re-releases existing CPython patch versions with
    newer SQLite (e.g. the 3.11.15 build was re-cut with SQLite 3.53.x), so a
    stale catalog can make every provisioning attempt resolve to a vulnerable
    build even though a fixed build of the SAME patch version exists (issue
    #72093).

    Only the Hermes-managed binary is refreshed: a caller that somehow passed
    a foreign uv path is left alone (no download), so this never touches a
    toolchain Hermes does not own.

    The throttle stamp is touched only when the installer actually ran and
    produced a runnable binary: a flaky network leaves it stale so the next
    update retries, while an unchanged upstream version (installer ran, same
    version) does not re-download on every update.

    Returns ``True`` when the binary's version actually changed — e.g. a
