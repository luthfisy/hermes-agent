"""Forced-skill validation for Kanban cards — one resolver, every creation surface.

A card's forced skills reach the worker as ``hermes --skills <name>`` and are loaded
by :func:`agent.skill_commands.build_preloaded_skills_prompt`, which reports a name it
cannot resolve as *missing* and lets the session continue. Nothing fails, so a typo'd
or category name costs a whole worker run in the wrong context and reads as a bad
model rather than a bad card. Validate once, before the card is queued, and once more
at the spawn boundary for cards written before that existed.

Resolution is scoped to the ASSIGNEE's profile: one gateway process serves many
profiles, and the creator's own skills say nothing about what the executor has
installed. The home is bound with ``set_hermes_home_override`` plus a secret scope for
the duration of the scan (the same scope-then-read ordering
``kanban_db_dispatch._resolve_worker_cli_toolsets`` uses), then released.

The validator fails OPEN whenever it cannot enumerate: an assignee with no profile
directory (control-plane lanes such as ``orion-cc``) or a scan that raises yields no
problems. Refusing a card because the check itself broke would be worse than the bug
it prevents.
