"""Route-agnostic non-interactive (bearer-token) auth seam for the dashboard.

This is the generic API-token capability (decisions.md Q-C): a reusable seam
that ANY service-to-service / machine-credential provider plugs into, NOT a
drain-specific hook. The drain bearer-secret plugin is merely the first
consumer.

How it fits the existing auth framework:

  * The interactive gate (``gated_auth_middleware``) authenticates a human
    via a session cookie on every non-public route. A service caller has no
    cookie — it presents a bearer token in the ``Authorization`` header on a
    single request. That is what this seam verifies.

  * A route opts in by registering its path via :func:`register_token_route`
    — exact match by default, or ``match="prefix"`` for routes with a dynamic
    segment (e.g. ``/api/sessions/{id}``). Only registered paths are
    token-authable; everything else is untouched, so this can never
    accidentally widen the auth surface of an existing route. Exact
    registrations always take precedence over prefix ones.

  * By default (``required=True``) a registered route is token-EXCLUSIVE:
    once registered, this seam is the only accepted auth scheme for it, and
    a request with no (or an invalid) bearer token is rejected outright —
    this is drain's original contract and remains unchanged. Pass
    ``required=False`` for a route that is ALSO reachable by the existing
    cookie/session gate (e.g. a dashboard page the desktop UI already
    renders): with no ``Authorization`` header at all, the seam is a no-op
    and the request falls through untouched to the downstream cookie gate.
    A *presented* bearer token (even an invalid one) is still fully decided
    by this seam alone — 401/503 as usual — so a genuine token-bearing
    caller gets the same contract either way. If the same path is
    registered more than once with different ``required`` values (exact,
    prefix, or regex), the stricter (``required=True``) always wins.

  * :func:`token_auth_middleware` runs OUTERMOST (installed last in
    ``web_server.py``). For a token route it fully owns the auth decision
    for any request that presents a bearer token, or for any request at all
    on a ``required=True`` route: authenticate via the stacked token
    providers, attach the verified
    :class:`~hermes_cli.dashboard_auth.base.TokenPrincipal` to
    ``request.state.token_principal`` + set ``request.state.token_authenticated``,
    and pass through; otherwise reject (401 unauthenticated, or 503 when a
    provider's backing store was unreachable). The downstream cookie/session
    gates honour ``token_authenticated`` and skip enforcement, so a
    token-authed service request is never bounced to ``/login``. A
    ``required=False`` route with no bearer token presented skips this
    seam entirely and is decided by the downstream cookie/session gates —
    which apply their own, separate trust model (see the module docstring
    caveat in ``web_server.py`` about not conflating a cookie-authenticated
    operator with a DM-scoped token principal).

  * Fails closed: a token route with no registered token provider, no token,
    or an unrecognised token gets 401 — never an open pass-through.

Provider stacking mirrors ``verify_session``: each ``supports_token`` provider
is consulted in registration order until one returns a principal. A provider
that doesn't recognise the token returns ``None`` and the seam moves on; a
provider whose backing store is unreachable raises ``ProviderError``, which the
seam remembers and surfaces as 503 only if NO provider accepts the token.

# ``/api/skills``, GET vs DELETE/PATCH ``/api/sessions/{id}``). Registering
# ``/api/skills`` token-authable for its GET reader would otherwise also make
# ``POST /api/skills`` (create-skill — agent-executed, i.e. code execution)
# token-authable for the same principal. Restricting the registration to
# ``{"GET", "HEAD"}`` confines the token to the read verb only.

    Idempotent. Call at module import / app setup so the seam knows which
    routes to guard. Registering a route does NOT make it public — it makes
    it authenticate by token instead of by session cookie.

    ``match`` is one of:

      * ``"exact"`` (default, unchanged behaviour) — matches only the literal
        path string.
      * ``"prefix"`` — matches any path starting with ``path``. Opt-in per
        call; existing exact registrations (e.g. the drain plugin's
        ``/api/gateway/drain``) are never reinterpreted as prefixes.
      * ``"regex"`` — ``path`` is a regex pattern matched with
        :func:`re.fullmatch` against ``request.url.path``. Use this instead
        of ``"prefix"`` when a dynamic path segment must be constrained to a
        known shape so sibling literal routes under the same parent path
        (e.g. ``/api/sessions/search`` next to ``/api/sessions/{id}``)
        cannot be swept in by accident — ``is_token_route`` has no HTTP-method
        awareness, so an over-broad prefix would make those siblings
        token-authable too even though nothing consulted their scope.

    Exact registrations always take precedence over regex/prefix ones.

    ``required`` (default ``True``) controls whether an absent bearer token
    falls through to the downstream cookie/session gate:

      * ``True`` (default) — token auth is exclusive for this path; a
        request with no bearer token is rejected 401 by this seam and never
        reaches the cookie gate. This is drain's original, unchanged
        contract.
      * ``False`` — a request with NO ``Authorization`` header at all is a
        no-op for this seam and falls through to whatever gate would have
        handled it otherwise (e.g. the existing cookie-authenticated
        desktop dashboard). A *presented* bearer token is still fully
        decided by this seam alone, same as ``required=True``.

    If the same path is registered multiple times (possibly with different
    ``required`` values), the stricter value (``True``) always wins — this
    keeps the fail-closed default from being weakened by a later, looser
    registration of the same path.

    ``methods`` restricts which HTTP methods this seam authenticates on
    ``path``. ``None`` (the default) means every method — drain's unchanged
    contract. Pass an explicit set (e.g. ``("GET", "HEAD")``) for a read-only
    registration: the seam then acts only on those methods, and a request
    using any other verb falls through to the cookie/session gate as if the
    path were not token-registered at all. This is required whenever a path
    serves both a read (GET) handler and a mutating (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
    handler — registering the reader as token-authable would otherwise expose
    the mutator to the same token principal, since route matching is
    path-based and cannot distinguish methods on its own. Method sets union
    across repeat registrations of the same path (a method is authable if ANY
    registration allows it; ``None`` unions to "all").
