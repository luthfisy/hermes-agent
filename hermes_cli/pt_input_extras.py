    Ctrl+A/C/D/... leak as text. Installs Ctrl/Alt/Shift letters, digits, symbols, multi-modifier
    combos, lock-bit variants, CSI-u Esc, modified Enter/Tab/Backspace/Space and Kitty functional
    keys. ``setdefault`` semantics: existing mappings (incl. the Shift/Ctrl+Enter aliases) win.

    * **Ctrl+letter** (a–z): ``ESC[27;5;<codepoint>~`` and ``ESC[<codepoint>;5u`` → ``Keys.ControlA`` .. *
    **Ctrl+digit** (0–9): same formats → ``Keys.Control0`` .. * **Ctrl+symbol** (``[`` ``\\`` ``]`` ``^``
    ``_`` `` `` ``@``): same formats → the same ``Keys`` value the raw control byte maps to. *
    **Alt+letter** (a–z, A–Z): ``ESC[27;3;<codepoint>~`` and ``ESC[<codepoint>;3u`` → ``(Keys.Escape,
    <letter>)`` — matching how prompt_toolkit handles a bare ``ESC`` followed by a character. *
    **Shift+letter** (a–z): → the uppercase character. * **Shift+symbol** (tilde form only): ``ESC[27;2;<cp>~``
    → ``chr(cp)`` for printable ASCII — xterm and Ghostty put the produced character in that codepoint (#114242).
    * **Multi-modifier letters** (Shift+Alt=4,
    Ctrl+Shift=6, Ctrl+Alt=7, Ctrl+Alt+Shift=8): normalized onto the same targets — Ctrl-bearing combos
    behave as the Ctrl key (Alt adds an ``Escape`` prefix), matching how dte/kakoune normalize these
    protocols. * **Lock-bit variants**: every CSI-u mapping above is also installed with the CapsLock (64)
    and NumLock (128) bits ORed into the modifier parameter — kitty/ghostty include them while a lock is on,
    and without the variants every key combo dies with the lock enabled (``ESC[99;133u`` instead of
    ``ESC[99;5u``, #89651). * **Esc key**: ``ESC[27u`` / ``ESC[27;<mod>u`` (Kitty disambiguate mode reports
    Esc this way, #56684) → ``Keys.Escape``. * **Modified Enter/Tab/Backspace/Space**: Alt+Enter → the
    Alt+Enter newline tuple; Shift+Tab → ``BackTab``; Ctrl+Tab → plain Tab; Ctrl/Alt+Backspace → ``(Escape,
    ControlH)`` (backward-kill-word, matching the Ink TUI and Desktop, #78285); Shift+Backspace → plain
    backspace; Shift+Space → a plain space (#86866); Alt+Space → ``(Escape, " ")``. * **Kitty functional
    keys** (Private Use Area codepoints): keypad keys → their non-keypad equivalents (KP_ENTER → Enter, KP_4
    → '4', KP_LEFT → Left, …); F13–F24 → ``Keys.F13``..``F24``; lock/media/ modifier-event keys →
    ``Keys.Ignore`` so they are consumed instead of leaking as literal text. kitty emits these CSI-u forms
