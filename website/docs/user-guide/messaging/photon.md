# Photon iMessage

Connect Hermes to **iMessage** through [Photon][photon], a managed
service that handles the Apple line allocation and abuse-prevention
layer so you don't have to run your own Mac relay.

The free tier uses Photon's shared iMessage line pool — different
recipients may see different sending numbers, but each conversation
stays stable. The paid Business tier gives every user the same
dedicated number; the plugin supports both, and the free tier is the
recommended starting point.

:::info Free to start
Photon's shared-line pool is free. No subscription is required to send
your first iMessage from Hermes — just a phone number we can bind to
your account.
:::

## Architecture

Photon is a **persistent-connection** channel, like Discord or Slack —
**no webhook, no public URL, no signing secret to manage.**

The `spectrum-ts` SDK holds a long-lived **gRPC stream** to Photon for
both directions. Because the SDK is TypeScript-only, Hermes runs it in a
small supervised **Node sidecar** and talks to it over loopback:

- **Inbound** — the sidecar consumes the SDK's `app.messages` gRPC
  stream and forwards each message to the Python adapter over a loopback
  `GET /inbound` (NDJSON). The adapter dedupes and dispatches it to the
  agent, reconnecting automatically if the stream drops.
- **Outbound** — replies are loopback POSTs to the sidecar, which calls
  `space.send(...)` on the SDK.

The Python plugin starts, supervises, and shuts down the sidecar
automatically.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or newer** on PATH (`node --version`)
- For managed cloud mode, a [Photon account][app] and a phone number that can
  receive iMessage
- For local mode, a Mac signed in to Messages with Full Disk Access granted to
  the process that starts Hermes

There is no public URL or tunnel to set up in either mode.

## First-time setup

### Open-source local mode

Use local mode when Hermes is running on a Mac signed in to your own
Apple ID and you want messages to send through that local Messages.app
account instead of Photon's managed/shared line pool:

```bash
PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS=+15551234567
```

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
photon:
  imessage_mode: local
```

Local mode uses Spectrum's dedicated open-source macOS provider
(`@spectrum-ts/imessage-local`). It does not use Photon dashboard login,
`PHOTON_PROJECT_ID`, or `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET`. The host must be signed into
Messages. The process that starts Hermes may need Full Disk Access to read
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`.

Spectrum local mode can start a DM from a bare E.164 number and rehydrate an
existing DM or group from its chat GUID. That means cold cron delivery works
with `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL=+1555...` for DMs. Creating a new group from a list
of recipients still requires managed Photon mode.

With the pinned Spectrum 12.7 local provider, text/markdown, inbound and
outbound attachments, DMs, incoming reply context, and existing groups work.
Local mode does not provide visible typing indicators, native outbound
replies, editing/unsending, tapbacks, native polls or effects, read receipts,
new-group creation, or group member/metadata changes. Hermes avoids the
unsupported presence/status calls and falls back to numbered text for
multiple-choice clarify prompts.

Then install the sidecar dependencies and start the gateway:

```bash
hermes photon install-sidecar
hermes gateway start
```

Cloud mode remains the default when `photon.imessage_mode` is unset.

Either run the unified gateway wizard, pick **iMessage via Photon**, and
choose **local** or **cloud**:

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

…or run the Photon setup directly (the wizard calls the same flow):

```bash
# Local Mac: no Photon login or project credentials
hermes photon setup --mode local --phone +15551234567

# Managed cloud: device login + project + user + sidecar deps
hermes photon setup --mode cloud --phone +15551234567
```

For local mode, setup saves `photon.imessage_mode: local`, configures the
optional phone allowlist/home channel, explains the Messages and Full Disk
Access requirements, and installs the sidecar dependencies.

Managed cloud setup, in order:

1. **Device login** (`client_id=photon-cli`) — opens
   `https://app.photon.codes/` for approval and stores the bearer token.
2. **Finds or creates** the `Hermes Agent` project on your account.
3. **Enables Spectrum**, reads the project's Spectrum id, and rotates
   the project secret.
4. **Registers your phone number** as a Spectrum user — skipped if a
   user with that number already exists, so re-running is safe.
5. **Prints your assigned iMessage line** — the number you text to reach
   your agent.
6. **Runs `npm install`** inside the plugin's sidecar directory. On
   read-only / immutable install trees (hosted Docker images, Podman,
   Nix) the sidecar automatically falls back to a writable mirror under
   `~/.hermes/photon/sidecar`; set `PHOTON_SIDECAR_DIR` to pin an
   explicit location.

Runtime credentials are written to `~/.hermes/.env`
(`PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` = the Spectrum project id, `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET`),
the same place every other channel keeps its token. Management metadata
(device token, dashboard project id) lives in `~/.hermes/auth.json` under
`credential_pool.photon` / `credential_pool.photon_project`.

## Authorizing users

Photon uses the same authorization model as every other Hermes
channel. Choose one approach:

**DM pairing (default).** When an unknown number messages your Photon
line, Hermes replies with a pairing code. Approve it with:

```bash
hermes pairing approve photon <CODE>
```

Use `hermes pairing list` to see pending codes and approved users.

**Pre-authorize specific numbers** (in `~/.hermes/.env`):

```bash
PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS=+15551234567,+15559876543
```

**Open access** (dev only, in `~/.hermes/.env`):

```bash
PHOTON_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```

When `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS` is set, unknown senders are silently
ignored rather than offered a pairing code (the allowlist signals you
deliberately restricted access).

### Require mentions in group chats

By default Hermes responds to every authorized DM and group message.
To make group chats opt-in, enable mention gating (DMs still always
work):

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    photon:
      enabled: true
      require_mention: true
```

With `require_mention: true`, group-chat messages are ignored unless
they match a wake-word pattern. The defaults match `Hermes` and
`@Hermes agent` variants. For a custom agent name, set regex patterns:

```yaml
gateway:
  platforms:
    photon:
      require_mention: true
      mention_patterns:
        - '(?<![\w@])@?amos\b[,:\-]?'
```

Both keys also accept env vars (`PHOTON_REQUIRE_MENTION`,
`PHOTON_MENTION_PATTERNS`). This is the same mention-gating model the
BlueBubbles iMessage channel uses.

## Start the gateway

```bash
hermes gateway start
```

You'll see something like:

```
[photon] connected — sidecar on 127.0.0.1:8789, streaming inbound over gRPC
```

Send an iMessage to your assigned number and Hermes will reply.

## Status & troubleshooting

```bash
hermes photon status
```

Prints saved credentials, sidecar health, your registered number, and the
assigned iMessage line Hermes uses. When a Photon token and dashboard project
are available, `status` refreshes missing number rows from the dashboard
without provisioning new lines.

```
Photon iMessage status
──────────────────────
  device token        : ✓ stored
  dashboard project   : 3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-...
  spectrum project id : sp-...
  project secret      : ✓ stored
  my number           : +15551234567
  assigned number     : +16282679185
  node binary         : /usr/bin/node
  sidecar deps        : ✓ installed
```

Common issues:

- **`sidecar deps : ✗ run hermes photon install-sidecar`** — Node is
  installed but `spectrum-ts` isn't. Run the suggested command.
- **`device token : ✗ missing`** — run `hermes photon setup` to log in.
- **`No iMessage line assigned yet`** — Spectrum is enabled but no line
  has been provisioned; re-run `hermes photon setup` or check the
  [dashboard][app].
- **Sidecar won't start** — confirm `node --version` is 20+ and that
  `hermes photon install-sidecar` completed without errors.

## Limits today

- **Inbound attachments are metadata-only.** Inbound events carry the
  filename + MIME type; the agent sees a marker but can't yet read the
  bytes. The SDK exposes attachment bytes via `content.read()`, so this
  is a sidecar follow-up.
- **Outbound attachments are supported.** Hermes sends images, voice
  notes, video, and documents through spectrum-ts' `attachment()` /
  `voice()` content builders via the sidecar's `/send-attachment`
  endpoint. Captions arrive as a separate iMessage bubble after the
  media.
- **Native polls are supported in managed cloud mode.** Hermes sends poll
  content through spectrum-ts' `poll()` builder via the sidecar's `/send-poll`
  endpoint. Local mode falls back to a numbered-text clarify prompt.
- **Read receipts are supported in managed cloud mode.** The sidecar marks an
  inbound iMessage read after forwarding it to Hermes, so the sender sees
  `Read` without waiting for a model/tool turn. Inbound receipts for Hermes-sent
  messages are consumed as presence telemetry and never create an agent turn. Set
  `PHOTON_READ_RECEIPTS=false` to keep messages at `Delivered`. The Spectrum
  12.7 local provider does not implement this operation, so Hermes skips it.
- **Message effects are supported in managed cloud mode.** Hermes sends text
  with native iMessage bubble/screen effects through spectrum-ts' iMessage
  `effect()` builder via the sidecar's `/send-effect` endpoint.
- **Photon's free quotas:** 5,000 messages per server per day,
  50 new-conversation initiations per shared line per day. Increases
  available — email `help@photon.codes`.
- **Cron and standalone sends need the gateway running.** Out-of-process
  senders (cron jobs, `hermes send`, the dashboard) reuse the sidecar the
  gateway spawned — they read its port/token from
  `<hermes-home>/runtime/photon-sidecar.json`, written once the sidecar
  passes its health check and removed when it stops. If a standalone send
  reports the gateway appears to be down, start (or restart) the gateway
  first.
- **Shared/free-tier lines can't initiate conversations with new
  targets.** Photon-side policy: a shared line can only message a number
  after that number has texted the line first. A cron/standalone send to a
  brand-new recipient will be rejected by Photon even when Hermes is set
  up correctly — either have the recipient message the line once, or move
  to a dedicated line.
