/**
 * Discard pending stdin bytes so in-flight escape sequences (mouse tracking
 * reports, bracketed-paste markers) don't leak to the shell after exit.
 *
 * Two layers of trickiness:
 *
 * 1. setRawMode is termios, not fcntl — the stdin fd stays blocking, so
 *    readSync on it would hang forever. Node doesn't expose fcntl, so we
 *    open /dev/tty fresh with O_NONBLOCK (all fds to the controlling
 *    terminal share one line-discipline input queue).
 *
 * 2. By the time forceExit calls this, detachForShutdown has already put
 *    the TTY back in cooked (canonical) mode. Canonical mode line-buffers
 *    input until newline, so O_NONBLOCK reads return EAGAIN even when
 *    mouse bytes are sitting in the buffer. We briefly re-enter raw mode
 *    so reads return any available bytes, then restore cooked mode.
 *
 * Safe to call multiple times. Call as LATE as possible in the exit path:
 * DISABLE_MOUSE_TRACKING has terminal round-trip latency, so events can
 * arrive for a few ms after it's written.
