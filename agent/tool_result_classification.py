    Shared by ``agent.display._detect_tool_failure`` and
    ``agent.tool_guardrails.classify_tool_failure`` so the CLI tag and the
    guardrail counter can never disagree about a memory result.

    ``done=True`` marks a payload the tool considers SETTLED — both the
    ordinary success and the terminal graceful degradation returned once
    consolidation has failed too often in one turn (#42405). Neither is a
    failure the model should react to, and counting one feeds the same-tool
    halt counter, which aborts the turn and suppresses the user-facing reply:
    the exact outcome #42405 exists to prevent.

    The ``done`` check comes FIRST and that order is load-bearing. An
    at-capacity refusal is routed through the same consolidation-failure
    budget, so the Nth consecutive one comes back as the terminal payload —
    at which point the model has been told to stop retrying and a ``[full]``
    tag is no longer actionable. (The two cannot both match in any case: the
    terminal payload carries a fixed error text that never mentions a limit.)

    ``None`` means "no memory verdict" — the caller keeps applying its own
    generic rules, exactly as each did before this was factored out. That is
    why the return is optional rather than ``(False, "")``.
