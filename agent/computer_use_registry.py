"""Registry of computer-use providers, and the rule for picking one.

Providers register at import time — the built-in host backend from
:mod:`tools.computer_use.host_provider`, third-party runtimes from their
plugin's ``register(ctx)`` via
:meth:`hermes_cli.plugins.PluginContext.register_computer_use_provider`.
:func:`resolve_provider` then answers which one services a call, from the
``computer_use.provider`` key in ``config.yaml``.

Selection is explicit, never inferred. computer_use has no history of
auto-detected cloud backends to preserve, and guessing here would silently
move where the agent's clicks land — so an unset key means the host backend
and nothing else auto-activates.

A configured name that nobody registered raises rather than falling back.
Quietly reverting to the host backend would drive the user's own desktop when
they had asked for a container, which is the one outcome worth crashing over;
:func:`tools.computer_use.tool.handle_computer_use` turns it into a message
naming the missing provider.
