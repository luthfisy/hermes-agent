        Ensures ``last_activity_at`` is durably persisted even when all

        contention. This fixes the "stuck timestamp" bug where the Desktop
        UI stops refreshing messages because ``last_activity_at`` never
        advances past the last successful heartbeat.

        Key design decisions (tri-model review 3/3 convergence):

        1. **Does NOT call ``_touch_activity``** — that method runs the
           kanban bridge (``inject_new_comments_from_env``) which can
           trigger a spurious continuation turn on a finished turn.
        2. **Does NOT bump in-memory ``_last_activity_ts``** — the gateway
           stall-watchdog relies on this value being preserved across
           interrupt-recursive turns (#15654). Bumping it at every nested
           finally would reset the accumulated-idle clock.
        3. **Uses elevated write patience** (``_ACTIVITY_FINALIZE_PATIENCE_S``
           = 2.0s) — the turn is already over, so there is no
           response-critical path to protect.
        4. **Atomic UPDATE** — stamps ts AND clears labels in one write,
           avoiding a transient ``turn completed`` label flash and halving
           teardown writes vs. touch-then-clear.
