"""Per-session turn lease — serializes the [load history -> run -> flush] region.

Busy guards are keyed by ROUTING KEY but the transcript is owned by SESSION_ID, and
``switch_session()`` makes key->id many-to-one (/resume from a second chat, CLI-continuity,
delegation pinning, topic tip-walks), so two keys could interleave flushes on one transcript
(``user;user`` wedge). The lease serializes per RESOLVED session_id: acquired right before the
transcript load, released in the dispatch layer's ``finally``; identity-checked release; a
timed-out waiter fails CLOSED (:class:`TurnLeaseTimeoutError`); only idle entries evict. Limits:
CLI-continuity processes are outside this lock; mid-turn rotation alias is closed by ``rebind``.

class TurnLease:
    """Async context manager over the merged cross-process session turn lease.

    ``async with TurnLease(state, session_id, holder) as acquired:``
    serializes the [load history → run → flush] region against the merged
    ``session_turn_leases`` table (``6e929a9694``, #67442), so a CLI process,
    a gateway process, or two ``hermes serve`` backends sharing one
    ``HERMES_HOME`` coordinate through the same DB row.  The in-process
    :class:`SessionTurnLeaseRegistry` above cannot see across process
    boundaries — this closes that gap for async callers.

    The storage layer is sync
    (``HermesState.try_acquire_session_turn_lease`` /
    ``refresh_session_turn_lease`` / ``release_session_turn_lease``); this
    wrapper adapts it to the event loop: each attempt is a short SQLite write
    and the wait between attempts is ``asyncio.sleep``, so the loop never
    blocks.

    Usage::

        async with TurnLease(
            state, session_id,
            holder=f"pid={os.getpid()}:turn={gen}:surface={surface}",
        ) as acquired:
            if not acquired:
                # Timed out — fail-open: proceed unserialized.
                ...
            # Critical section: load history → run → flush.
            ...

    .. rubric:: Protocol

    On enter, polls :meth:`HermesState.try_acquire_session_turn_lease` with
    capped exponential backoff until the lease is acquired or the overall
    ``wait_timeout`` expires.  Returns ``True`` when the lease was acquired,
    ``False`` on timeout (fail-open — the caller proceeds unserialized rather
    than wedging the session).  ``degraded`` is ``True`` exactly when
    exclusivity was NOT proven.

    On exit, calls :meth:`HermesState.release_session_turn_lease`.  Guaranteed
    on every exit path: normal return, exception, and cancellation.  If a
    background refresh task is running it is cancelled first.

    .. rubric:: Holder contract

    ``holder`` is the fence identity: the merged flush layer raises
    :class:`hermes_state.SessionTurnLeaseLostError` when a transcript write
    presents a holder that no longer owns the lease, and the dead-PID reclaim
    parses ``pid=`` out of the holder string to reap crashed holders without
    waiting for the TTL.  Pass a holder embedding the local PID (same
    convention as the merged ``run_agent`` consumer's
    ``f"pid={os.getpid()}:turn=<id>:platform=<...>"``).

    .. rubric:: Background refresh

    Set ``refresh_interval`` (seconds) to periodically bump the lease expiry
    during long turns via :meth:`HermesState.refresh_session_turn_lease`.  The
    refresh task is cancelled on exit.  Without it, a turn that runs longer
    than ``ttl_seconds`` will see its lease expire — the next acquirer
    reclaims the stale row and the two turns interleave.

    .. rubric:: Safety properties

    - **Fail-open on timeout.**  Returns ``False`` after ``wait_timeout``
      with a loud ERROR log, never a wedged session.  Posture per #67442:
      interactive user turns wait with a bounded budget; machine-initiated
      paths should choose the storage layer's fail-closed semantics instead.
    - **Guaranteed release.**  ``__aexit__`` is called on every path,
      including cancellation.  The DB row is deleted iff this holder still
      owns it (identity-checked by ``release_session_turn_lease``).
    - **Expired/dead-holder reclamation.**  The storage layer deletes stale
      rows transparently, so a crashed holder wedges the session for at most
      ``ttl_seconds``, not indefinitely.
