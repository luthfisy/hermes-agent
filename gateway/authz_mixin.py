    """Pure authorization decision for an inbound (or Mini-App-asserted) sender.

    Mechanically lifted out of ``GatewayAuthorizationMixin._is_user_authorized``
    — same checks, same order, same env vars — with every ``self._adapter_*``
    call replaced by an injected callable so this function has no dependency on
    a live ``GatewayRunner``/adapter registry. The five ``adapter_*`` callables
    default to "no live adapter for this platform" (mirrors
    ``_authorization_adapter`` returning ``None``), so a caller with no adapter
    to consult — e.g. the Telegram Mini App dashboard, which authorizes a
    ``initData``-verified user_id with no inbound-message adapter in the
    picture — can omit them entirely and get the same env-allowlist /
    pairing-store decision a live Telegram adapter's DM traffic would get.

    Deliberately does NOT read ``_HERMES_HOME_OVERRIDE`` or resolve
    config/profile itself — every profile-scoped fact (adapter policy, the
    pairing store lookup) is passed in by the caller. Authorization here is
    process-global by construction, not because of a check that could be
    forgotten; there is nothing profile-aware left to accidentally add.

    ``pairing_is_approved`` is a callable, not a ``PairingStore`` instance,
    so it is only invoked (and any attribute on the caller's store only
    touched) once the checks above it actually require a pairing-store
    lookup — matching the original method, which never touched
    ``self.pairing_store`` for a request an earlier branch already resolved
    (e.g. the chat-scoped ``TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_CHATS`` allowlist above).

    ``on_legacy_group_users_warning``, if given, is invoked at most once per
    call with the comma-joined legacy chat-ID string when the
    ``TELEGRAM_GROUP_ALLOWED_USERS`` backward-compat shim (#15027) fires; the
    caller owns any "warn once" state (was ``self._warned_telegram_group_users_legacy``).

    ``env_get`` replaces every internal ``os.getenv`` call (default: real
    ``os.getenv``, so the live gateway's behavior is bit-for-bit unchanged).
    A caller with its own process — one whose ``os.environ`` was populated
    once at import time and never refreshed, e.g. a long-lived dashboard
    process checking Telegram Mini App tier access — can pass a callable
    that re-reads the relevant vars fresh per call instead of trusting a
    stale process-wide snapshot, without this function mutating
    ``os.environ`` itself or knowing anything about where those fresh
    values come from.

    ``platform_gate_env`` reads the two boolean/allowlist "gate" vars
    (chat-scoped allowlist, ``{PLATFORM}_ALLOW_BOTS``) upstream hardened to
    the shared ``gateway.platforms._shared.platform_gate_env`` reader rather
    than the plain ``env_get`` every other read here still uses: under
    multiplex, a key absent from the profile's secret scope must return
    ``default`` rather than falling through to ``os.environ``, which can hold
    ANOTHER profile's first-writer-bridged value for the same var name
    (#72348) -- a false affirmative on a gate check leaks profile A's
    allowlist into profile B, unlike the other ``env_get`` reads here where
    that fallthrough is comparatively benign. Defaults to the real shared
    reader, matching ``env_get``'s real-``os.getenv`` default, so live
    behavior is unchanged.

    ``adapter_group_allowed_chats`` and ``adapter_allow_from`` cover the two
    config.yaml-only allowlist fallbacks some adapters (e.g. Telegram) support
    via ``platforms.<platform>.extra.group_allowed_chats`` / ``allow_from`` /
    ``group_allow_from`` — configured access that has no env var equivalent.
    Both default to "nothing configured" (empty set) when there is no live
    adapter to consult, same rationale as the other ``adapter_*`` defaults.

    ``adapter_dm_is_allowed`` re-checks a DM sender against the *live* adapter's
    allowlist before honoring an ``allowlist`` intake policy (#34515): a pairing
    revoke can clear the env allowlist while a construction-time snapshot on the
    adapter would otherwise keep authorizing until restart. It returns ``None``
    for an adapter that exposes no such helper (and by default, when there is no
    live adapter at all), which preserves the historical "reached the gateway
    under allowlist policy is enough" behavior for those adapters rather than
    failing closed on callers that have no adapter to consult.

    ``adapter_resolved_allowlist_user_ids`` unions the live adapter's own
    resolved numeric allowlist (e.g. Discord's ``resolved_allowlist_user_ids()``)
    into the env-derived allowlist. Adapters that resolve username-shaped
    allowlist entries to numeric IDs at connect time keep the authoritative
    resolved set in adapter memory and mirror it into the process env, but a
    per-turn env hot-reload can restore the raw username strings from disk —
    from the second turn onward the env-derived allowlist then holds usernames
    while ``source.user_id`` is numeric, and the operator is wrongly dropped as
    unauthorized. Only consulted when an env allowlist is configured (never a
    widening of the empty-allowlist fail-closed default) and duck-typed +
    isinstance-guarded so a caller with no adapter, or a mock one, gets the
    historical env-only behavior unchanged.

    ``adapter_allow_bots_mode``, if given, resolves the effective
    ``{PLATFORM}_ALLOW_BOTS`` mode ("none"/"mentions"/"all") for a live
    adapter's routed profile, checking its YAML ``config.extra.allow_bots``
    when the scoped env var is unset (#72348 follow-up: a secondary
    multiplex profile's config is never bridged into the process env, so
    the plain env-only read below would silently drop its bot-admission
    setting). ``None`` (the default) falls back to a single
    ``platform_gate_env`` read, matching the historical env-only behavior
    for callers with no adapter to consult.
