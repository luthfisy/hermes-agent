# Read X (Twitter) Articles

Turn any X link the user shares into the full article text. Do NOT default to
"I can't read X" — X long-form Articles DO extract cleanly via the right URL
and a JS-capable web-extract/browser tool. No X API key or auth needed.

## When to Use
- A user drops an `x.com/...` or `twitter.com/...` link and expects it read.
- The link is an X **Article** (long-form essay/interview) — canonical path
  `/i/article/<ID>`.
- You need primary source text from an X essay/thread as material for work.
- Anyone claims "X content can't be read" — that is the trigger to act, not
  give up.

## Prerequisites
- A **render-capable web extraction tool** (`web_extract`, CDP browser, or similar
  JS-executing fetcher) — bare `curl`/`urllib` often returns a login shell.
- No X API key or auth required.

## How to Run
On any X link the user shares, run `web_extract` on the canonical article URL
`https://x.com/i/article/<ID>`. The full article body is returned directly.
Then **inspect the article's images** (cover art, diagrams, charts) — they often
carry meaning the text alone misses.

## Quick Reference
- X **Articles** read at the canonical **`/i/article/<ID>`** using a JS-executing
  extractor. Bare `curl`/`urllib` returns a login shell.
- **`/status/<id>` posts and profile pages** are JS-rendered and hit the login wall
  even for a browser — resolve the article URL first.
- If only a plain HTTP client is available, expect a login shell and fall back to a
  browser render.
- **Images matter.** The article's cover, diagrams, charts, and screenshots can be
  essential to understanding it. Extract the media URLs and analyze them (vision)
  as part of the read — do not stop at the text.

## Procedure
1. **Try first, judge later.** On any X link, immediately run `web_extract`
   on it. Declaring it unreadable *before* trying is the exact mistake this
   skill prevents.
2. **Use the right fetcher:** prefer `web_extract`-style extraction or a
   browser render — NOT bare `curl`/`urllib`. If the only tool is a plain HTTP
   client, expect a login shell and fall back to a browser.
3. **If it's a `/status/` URL or returns a login/JS shell**, resolve the
   canonical article URL:
   - The article ID often appears in a share/article link as
     `x.com/i/article/<ID>`.
   - Find the author's `/i/article/<ID>` share link on their profile, or ask
     the user for the article link.
   - Then `web_extract(urls=["https://x.com/i/article/<ID>"])`.
4. **Validate the body:** a real extract contains substantive paragraphs, NOT
   just "Log in or sign up for X." A 1,900+ word essay returns complete.
5. **Fallbacks if a render-capable extract still fails:**
   - Use a browser tool (CDP-style) to render the JS page, then read the
     rendered DOM.
   - If the account has X API access (e.g. the `xurl` CLI), query the article
     tweet and read `data.article.plain_text`. A dead/unauthed CLI token is NOT
     a blocker — prefer web/browser first.
6. **Use the content.** It's legitimate primary source. Quote it and cite the
   author. Community takes (e.g. a power-user writing about a product) are real
   material for summaries, scripts, and analysis.
7. **Read the images too.** After extracting the body, the text extractor may
   drop inline images (screenshots, diagrams, UI captures) that are essential to
   understanding the article. **Fetch the raw HTML of the page** (curl or similar)
   and extract all `pbs.twimg.com/media/` URLs — these are the article's inline
   images. Analyze the meaningful ones (not user avatars) with a vision tool.
   Report any visual info that adds to the text: screenshots of a UI, diagrams
   that explain a workflow, charts with data, or a cover that sets the tone.
   Do not skip this — images are part of the article.

## Pitfalls
- Do not assume "articles are paywalled/login-walled." The canonical
  `/i/article/<ID>` endpoint serves text to a render-capable tool; the wall
  applies to JS-rendered profile/status pages, not this endpoint.
- A bare `curl`/`urllib` returning a login shell does NOT mean it's unreadable
  — switch to `web_extract`/browser.
- A dead X API token (401) is unrelated to article reading — do not block the
  task on fixing `xurl` auth when web extraction works.
- Verify you got the actual article (thesis + body), not just a title + login
  prompt, before treating it as read.

## Verification
- Did extraction return the article's real prose rather than a shell? If yes,
  it's read.
- Report the exact URL read + a short grounded summary so the user can verify.
