"""Profile-local durable audit ledger for cron execution attempts.

The ledger records what is known about each attempt; it is not a retry queue. Interrupted attempts
become ``unknown`` only after their owner process is proved gone — a start-time reading that fails
to match the claim-time fingerprint is not proof of death. Terminal states are immutable, with one
exception: ``unknown`` means the ledger never learned the outcome, so that row may be closed ONCE
against external evidence (``reconcile_execution`` / ``hermes cron reconcile``).

    the run's own report, an idempotency check against the system it wrote to — and leaving the

    assertion, backed by *evidence*, may close it. It is durable: who did it, when, on what path,

    Deliberately narrow, and narrow on purpose rather than by omission:

    * Any row that is not ``unknown`` is refused. ``claimed``/``running`` have a live owner and an
      outcome that is not yet known; ``completed``/``failed`` are the ledger's own observations.
      A second reconcile of the same row is refused for the same reason — evidence is not silently
      replaceable. The refusal is the guarded ``UPDATE``, so two concurrent reconciles cannot both
      win, and a row that moved on between the read and the write loses cleanly.
    * *status* is ``completed`` or ``failed``: the ledger records what happened, not why the row was
      dark (the interruption stays on the job record).
    * ``finished_at`` is left as it is. It is the instant the ledger closed the row; the true finish
      time is exactly the thing nobody knows, and stamping the reconcile time over it would invent
      an instant to hide a gap.
    * ``error`` follows the outcome: cleared for ``completed`` (a completed attempt has no error, as
      ``finish_execution`` keeps it), and for ``failed`` the note when one was given, otherwise the
      text the row already carried.

    This is not a run: no slot, no claim, no ``next_run_at``. Repairing the job record that read
    ``interrupted`` is a separate, more narrowly guarded step — ``cron.jobs.reconcile_job_record``.
