# Genie — VPS Disk Cleanup

Safely reclaims disk space on Linux VPS and workstations by deleting or compressing stale state snapshots, logs, cron output, temp files, and package caches. Also owns `/root` disk-spike investigation, duplicate repo detection, and backup-retention audits formerly covered by `util-vps-cleanup`. Does not touch live databases, auth files, or active sessions.

## When to Use

- VPS disk usage is high (above 50%)
- User asks to "clean up disk space" or "check disk usage"
- User asks why disk usage grew or where space went
- `/root` needs a safe audit/classification pass
- Backup directories, snapshots, or `.bak-*` files may violate retention
- Weekly maintenance cron fires
- Before/after large operations (backups, migrations)

## When NOT to Use

- Database maintenance tasks (genie does not manage databases)
- Real-time monitoring or alerting
- Log rotation configuration (genie handles specific files, not system-wide logrotate)

## Prerequisites

No external dependencies — uses only Python 3.11+ stdlib.

Configuration lives in `config.yaml` under `skills.config.genie.*` (see Configuration below). Behavioral settings are never read from environment variables.

## How to Run

```bash
# Assess disk usage and identify cleanup targets
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py --assess

# Execute cleanup (Tier 1 + Tier 2)
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py --clean

# Dry run — preview without deleting
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py --clean --dry-run

# Map filesystem and generate FILESYSTEM.md manifest
python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py --discover
```

For large file counts (>2,000), run in background: `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)`.

## Quick Reference

| Flag | Action |
|------|--------|
| `--assess` | Report disk usage and cleanup targets |
| `--clean` | Execute Tier 1 + Tier 2 cleanup |
| `--clean --tier 1` | Only Tier 1 (zero risk) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without modifying anything |
| `--discover` | Map filesystem, create/update FILESYSTEM.md |
| `--analyze` | Tier 3 analysis only (read-only) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Backup Retention Rule

The VPS should keep **only one historical backup at a time**, plus current live data. Genie owns detecting and reporting violations.

Historical backup candidates include:
- `/root/backup/*`
- `/root/backups/*`
- `/root/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/state-snapshots/*` (profile-scoped — the bare `/root/.hermes/state-snapshots` is a different, usually-empty path)
- `/root/.hermes/migrations/*/backups/*`
- profile DB `.bak-*` files under `/root/.hermes/profiles/*/commons/db/`

Default behavior:
1. local full `state.db` backup copies are invalid unless explicitly requested
2. keep the newest valid historical backup
3. mark older or invalid historical backups as reclaimable
4. do not create an additional local historical backup unless replacing the retained one
5. after a replacement backup is verified, remove the superseded backup
6. report path, size, timestamp, and reclaimed/expected space

For the full audit workflow, see `references/root-audit-and-backup-retention.md`.

## Procedure

1. **Locate the script** — check these paths in order:
   - `/root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py` (profile — note `ocas-` prefix)
   - `/root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/scripts/genie.py` (profile scripts dir — alternate location)
   - `/root/.hermes/skills/ocas-genie/scripts/genie.py` (skill-bundled)
   - Use absolute paths only — never `~` in cron context
   - **Gotcha**: the skill folder is `ocas-genie/`, not `genie/`. A literal read of the old path will fail with ENOENT.

2. **Assess** — run `--assess` to identify targets

3. **Execute** — run `--clean` (or `--clean --dry-run` to preview)

4. **Report & verify** — `df -h /` after cleanup, then MANDATORY post-clean checks: confirm the `state-snapshots/` dir still holds the most-recent snapshot (do NOT trust a `0.0 B snapshots` line as proof), and run `PRAGMA integrity_check` on live DBs the user cares about (e.g. `styx.db`, `transactions.db`). See Verification. Note genie logs no per-file manifest, so capture pre-clean dir listings if an audit trail is needed.

## Manual / Investigative Targets

Some large disk consumers require an audit pass before cleanup because they may be live data, backups, or duplicate worktrees. Use `references/root-audit-and-backup-retention.md` for the full procedure.

1. **Manual backups** (`/root/backup/`, `/root/backups/`) — enforce one historical backup total on the VPS. Keep newest valid backup; older backups are reclaimable.
2. **Pre-update snapshots** (`/root/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/state-snapshots/`) — count as historical backups. Keep only the newest valid one once the post-update gateway is confirmed healthy. **CAUTION:** `backup_retention` may delete this snapshot despite the preservation rule (see Known Issues) — verify it survived after every `--clean`.
3. **Migration backups** (`/root/.hermes/migrations/*/backups/`) — count as historical backups. Keep only if they are the newest/only valid historical backup.
4. **Pre-migration `.bak-*` files** (`profiles/*/commons/db/*/.bak-*`) — count as historical backups. Reclaim older ones once the live DB has newer writes and integrity checks pass.
5. **Duplicate git repos** — compare remote + HEAD before removing. Same remote and same HEAD = duplicate candidate.
6. **Browser caches** (`~/.cache/camoufox/`) — safe to delete when no creating process is running.
7. **Stale /tmp extracts** (`/tmp/camoufox-*/`, `/tmp/uc_*/`, `/tmp/body_*`) — safe to delete when no creating process is running.
8. **state.db VACUUM** — Genie does not run `VACUUM` automatically. Report bloat/freelist only.

When disk is critically high, flag these in the report even if `--clean` cannot auto-clean them.

## Safety Rules

- NEVER modify `state.db` directly — Tier 3 analysis only. Note: `/root/.hermes/state.db` is typically a symlink to a profile's DB (e.g., `→ profiles/indigo/state.db`). Resolve symlinks before analyzing or reporting.
- Enforce the one-historical-backup rule: keep current live data plus the newest valid historical backup; older backup copies/snapshots are reclaimable.
- NEVER delete files without compressing first (Tier 2+) unless they are superseded historical backups being removed under the one-backup retention rule.
- ALWAYS report what was done
- If disk usage is below 50%, report "no action needed"
- If any operation fails, report the error and continue
- If a snapshot deletion fails, leave the snapshot in place and report at the end
- The most recent snapshot is always preserved (never auto-deleted) — `backup_retention_plan()` now excludes `state-snapshot` candidates so the cross-class "keep 1" rule can never reclaim it (FIXED 2026-07-16; see Known Issues). Still verify the snapshot dir survived after every `--clean`; do not read `clean_snapshots`'s `freed 0.0 B` as proof it survived.
- **Do not preserve multiple backups**: The VPS policy is one historical backup plus current live data. Count all historical backup classes together (`/root/backup`, `/root/backups`, snapshots, migration backups, `.bak-*`) and report/remove older valid copies.

## Known Issues / Pitfalls

### Snapshot retention bug (RESOLVED 2026-07-16)
Previously, `clean_backup_retention` kept only the single newest candidate across ALL backup classes combined, which could push the most-recent pre-update `state-snapshot` into `reclaim` and `rm -rf` it (the bug that deleted the 13 GB pre-update rollback snapshot on 2026-07-12). `backup_retention_plan()` now **excludes `state-snapshot` candidates** (genie.py:`backup_retention_plan`) so the cross-class "keep 1" rule can never reclaim a snapshot. The most recent snapshot is still preserved independently by `clean_snapshots()`. This bug is resolved; verify the snapshot dir directly after any `--clean` run (see Verification); do not read `clean_snapshots`'s `freed 0.0 B` as proof the snapshot survived. Full analysis and reproduction recipe: `references/genie-snapshot-retention-bug.md`.

### genie emits no per-file deletion manifest
`--clean` prints only aggregate totals (e.g. "backup_retention: freed 26.6 GB"). Deleted paths are NOT logged. Once files are removed they are unrecoverable (no git/LFS tracking of `/root/.hermes`). To answer "what was deleted," reconstruct by comparing directory state before/after — you cannot recover a file list from the tool output. Always capture `ls -la` of every backup class BEFORE `--clean` if you need an audit trail.

### Wrong snapshot path in older docs
The pre-update snapshot lives at `/root/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/state-snapshots` (profile-scoped), confirmed by `FILESYSTEM.md` and genie's `snapshots_path` default. The bare path `/root/.hermes/state-snapshots` is a different, usually-empty directory — do not verify against it.

### Decoy-script trap + unreachable prune (CONFIRMED root cause of /root/backup bloat, 2026-07-13)
When re-investigating disk spikes from backup copies, the **live writer is `backup_all_hermes_data.sh`** (`/root/indigo-repo/scripts/...`, exec'd via the ocas-custodian wrapper), NOT `backup_system.sh`. `backup_system.sh` targets `/root/backups` (plural) and is **unused** — an earlier scan blamed it for "zero retention logic," which was wrong. The live `backup_all_hermes_data.sh` DOES have a prune line (`find /root/backup -mtime +3 -exec rm -rf`), but it sits at **line 114**, *after* the `cp /root/.hermes/state.db` (symlink -> 14G profile DB) at **line 51**, under `set -euo pipefail`. On a near-full disk the `cp` hits ENOSPC, the script aborts, and the prune **never runs** -> partial `active-dbs-*` dirs accumulate (all lacking `state.db` = the ENOSPC-abort signature).

**FIX APPLIED 2026-07-14 (verify before re-patching):** the prune was moved to BEFORE the 14G cp, a free-space guard (`readlink -f` + `stat -L`, skip copy if `avail < size*1.1`) was added, and `trap cleanup_partial ERR` removes the partial dir on failure. See `references/backup-prune-diskfull-trap.md` STATUS + Verification recipe — run the recipe first; if all three checks pass, the fix is intact and you must NOT re-apply it (doing so would duplicate the guards). The separate TASK-015 (state.db FTS-trigram bloat, VACUUM) is a distinct open task and is NOT covered by this fix.

**Re-investigation discipline:** to find the live writer, follow the real chain (read `jobs.json` `command`/`script_path`, grep `/root/.hermes/cron/output/*/*.md` for the job name, follow `exec` chains in wrappers). Do NOT conclude root cause from a plausibly-named sibling. And check whether a retention line is *reachable* — a prune after a large/failing `cp` under `set -e` is dead code on a full disk.

## Error Handling

- **gzip failures:** If `gzip -t` reports a `.gz` is corrupt but the original exists, keep the original and regenerate. Never delete the original while the gzip is corrupt.
- **Concurrent gzip race:** Only one gzip per file. A timed-out foreground command can leave a background shell that spawns a second gzip. Verify with `gzip -t`, then remove the original.
- **Disk-at-100%:** Focus on immediate space recovery (Tier 1 cleanup) before any backup workflow.
- **Snapshot deletion failure:** Leave the snapshot in place, report the error, continue to next target.

## What Genie Cleans

### Tier 1 — Zero Risk (auto-executed)
1. **Stale state snapshots** — directories older than 7 days (most recent always preserved)
2. **Old log files** — compress after 7 days, delete compressed after 30 days
3. **Old cron output** — compress after 7 days
4. **Stale `/tmp` files** — delete after 24 hours
5. **Package caches** — pip, uv, npm (all rebuildable)
6. **Browser profile caches** — `~/.cache/camoufox/` (rebuildable, often 1+ GB)
7. **Inactive git clones** — `/root/projects/` dirs untouched >5 days with confirmed remote (safe to re-clone)

### Tier 2 — Low Risk (requires confirmation)
1. **Session JSON duplicates** — compress after 14 days (data also in `state.db`)

### Tier 3 — Analysis Only (never auto-executes)
1. **state.db bloat analysis** — reports DB size, freelist waste
2. **Large directories** — reports git checkpoints, commons/data, commons/db for manual review

## Configuration

Genie reads all behavioral settings from `config.yaml` under
`skills.config.genie.*`. Set them with `hermes config set` or by editing
`config.yaml` directly. CLI flags (e.g. `--dry-run`) override config at runtime.
Any setting not present falls back to the built-in default shown below.

| Config key (`skills.config.genie.*`) | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot_max_age_days` | 7 | Delete snapshots older than N days |
| `log_compress_age_days` | 7 | Compress logs older than N days |
| `log_delete_age_days` | 30 | Delete compressed logs older than N days |
| `cron_output_compress_age_days` | 7 | Compress cron output files older than N days |
| `session_compress_age_days` | 14 | Compress session JSONs older than N days |
| `tmp_stale_hours` | 24 | Delete /tmp files older than N hours (0 to skip) |
| `git_clone_max_age_days` | 5 | Delete git clones in /root/projects/ untouched for N days (must have remote) |
| `dry_run` | false | If true, only report — don't delete/compress |
| `filesystem_md` | (empty) | Optional override path for FILESYSTEM.md |
| `allow_local_state_db_backup` | false | If true, local full state.db copies count as valid retained backups |

## Verification

- `df -h /` — check disk usage dropped
- `du -sh /root/.hermes/` — check .hermes size
- **Snapshot survival (MANDATORY):** `ls -la /root/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/state-snapshots/` — the most-recent pre-update snapshot dir MUST still be present. If empty, `backup_retention` deleted it (see Known Issues). A `snapshots: freed 0.0 B` line does NOT prove preservation.
- **Live DB integrity:** for each live DB the user cares about, run `sqlite3 <db> "PRAGMA integrity_check;"` and confirm `ok`. For Styx: `/root/.hermes/data/styx.db` (often a symlink to the repo copy) and the live Plaid source `/root/.hermes/data/transactions.db`. Resolve symlinks first.
- Session search still works (confirms state.db intact)
