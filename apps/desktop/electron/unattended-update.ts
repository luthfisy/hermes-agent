/**
 * Unattended (scheduled) Windows Desktop update — pure, dependency-free core.
 *
 * A LOCAL-OPT-IN schedule: the user enables it in the Desktop's own Settings,
 * picks a local wall-clock time, and Hermes may run its OWN updater at that
 * time unattended. It is OFF by default and never turns itself on.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT (what this module guarantees and what it deliberately does NOT):
 *
 *   * Default OFF  — `parseUnattendedSchedule` fails CLOSED: anything that
 *     isn't an unambiguous `{ enabled: true, hour: 0-23, minute: 0-59 }`
 *     parses to disabled (including garbage input and missing config).
 *   * Local only   — the schedule is stored in the Desktop's own userData
 *     JSON (`updates.json`), read/written by the Electron main process. It is
 *     never stored on a remote backend or in any config a remote agent could
 *     reach, and it is only configurable through the local Desktop Settings
 *     IPC bridge (`hermes:updates:schedule:*`). Nothing here reads git.
 *   * Own updater only — this module only ever decides WHEN to attempt an
 *     update; it never executes anything. The main-process driver feeds the
 *     decision into Hermes' existing `applyUpdates()` hand-off, which spawns
 *     only the repo-owned `scripts/desktop-update/windows.ps1` (PowerShell)
 *     or the staged signed `hermes-setup.exe`. There is no raw `git` call and
 *     no OS shell beyond that narrow updater path.
 *   * Refuses when unsafe — `decideScheduledAttempt` returns `not-due` /
 *     `disabled` / `not-windows` / `recently-ran` without ever suggesting a
 *     run; the driver separately refuses when a live update lock owns the
 *     tree (`updateHandoffConflict`). An unattended update never mutates a
 *     checkout another updater already owns.
 *   * Relaunch — the hand-off script rebuilds and relaunches the Desktop and
 *     writes `.hermes-update-result.json`; the Desktop itself does no
 *     relaunch work and this module none at all.
 *   * Least privilege — everything runs as the same unprivileged user that
 *     launched the Desktop: no elevation, no SYSTEM account. On Windows the
 *     local opt-in ALSO registers ONE per-user, non-elevated Task Scheduler
 *     task (electron/scheduled-task.ts) that covers the "app is CLOSED" half
 *     of the runway — it runs only the repo-owned updater hand-off, requires
 *     no stored credentials, and is removed when the opt-in is disabled.
 *
 * Scheduling model (deliberately minimal and safe): the timer is armed for the
 * NEXT occurrence of the chosen local time. If the app is running then, it
 * gates a single attempt and then re-arms for the next day. If the app is
 * closed at that instant, that night's update is simply skipped — an
 * unattended updater must never surprise a user who quit the app. A bounded
 * GRACE WINDOW after the target time lets a Desktop that launched just after
 * the minute still catch its slot (see `isWithinScheduledWindow`), and the
 * `cooldownMs` guard in `decideScheduledAttempt` prevents more than one attempt
 * ever landing inside a single window.
