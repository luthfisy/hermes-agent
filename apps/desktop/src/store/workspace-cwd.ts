/**
 * THE conversation → workspace resolution.
 *
 * A conversation's workspace has two possible sources and they must not be
 * confused:
 *
 *  - the LIVE path (`$currentCwd`), which is authoritative only for the
 *    conversation that OWNS it (`$workspaceCwdOwner`);
 *  - the conversation's own stored row, which the sidebar already holds.
 *
 * Surfaces that paint a workspace (the Files pane, the coding rail) used to
 * depend on the first alone. That marker is stamped by whatever happened to run
 * last — a resume's preview paint, a `session.info`, a create — so any
 * conversation whose claim was never stamped read as "no workspace" for the
 * rest of the session, even though a row naming the exact same folder was on
 * screen in its project lane (#108805: identical `cwd` rows, one shows the
 * tree, the rest never do).
 *
 * The second source must therefore be consulted by the resolution itself, and
 * it must be looked for in EVERY list that can hold a row — a conversation
 * drilled into from a project lane lives in the lane's rows, not in the
 * paginated recents slice.
 *
 * What stays sacred: a LIVE path that is NOT owned by the selected conversation
 * is still never published (that is #71254 — the previous conversation's folder
 * must not paint under the newly selected chat). The fallback answers, at most,
 * "the selected conversation's OWN row names this folder"; when no loaded row
 * names one, the resolution returns '' and the panes stay hidden as before.
