/**
 * graftRefreshedTailOntoBackfill with two fixes:
 *
 * 1. anchor === 0: `preserveLocalAssistantErrors` APPENDS preserved local rows
 *    (user prompt + failed assistant pair) AFTER the merged tail. On the next
 *    graft those rows can trail the refreshed tail, so the anchor lookup fails
 *    with anchor === 0 — and the old code returned the bare tail, silently
 *    dropping the preserved rows (they reappear on the next successful
 *    hydrate: the "messages vanish and come back" symptom).
 * 2. anchor < 0 (anchorless): after a compaction rewrite every row id in the
 *    transcript is new, so the lookup cannot match anything and the refreshed
 *    tail was adopted wholesale. A read landing while that rewrite is in
 *    flight (or lagging it) returns a page without the newest settled reply —
 *    a reply the user already saw vanished from the view while the row stayed
 *    intact in the store. The newest settled local reply is held back and
 *    re-appended when it is strictly newer than anything the page carries and
 *    its text is absent from the page, so a page that has genuinely moved
 *    past it still wins and nothing can be duplicated.
