# hermes-advisor-plugin

A persistent second-model review plugin for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent):
a second model that reviews the main agent's work each turn and delivers
structured advice inline.

Inspired by and ported from [pi-omplike-advisor](https://github.com/pasky/pi-omplike-advisor)
by Petr Baudis (pasky), which brought the oh-my-pi advisor onto upstream pi's
extension surface. This is the same idea, adapted to Hermes' plugin system and
its different hook model.

## What it does

The advisor is a stateless reviewer that runs after every completed agent turn.
It receives the turn transcript (user message, tool calls, tool results,
assistant response), reviews it through a separate model, and delivers
structured advice back into the conversation.

Advice uses three severity levels:

| Tag | Meaning | Delivery |
|---|---|---|
| `[NIT]` | Non-urgent cleanup, missed opportunity | Injected immediately |
| `[CONCERN]` | Wrong direction, fragile approach, missing constraint | Held for reconfirmation |
| `[BLOCKER]` | Fundamentally unsound path | Held for reconfirmation |

Concerns and blockers are held across turns. On the next review, the advisor
sees them again in a reconfirmation preamble. If the advisor stays silent about
a previously held item, it is considered resolved and dropped. This prevents
stale advice from cluttering the conversation.

The advisor is **not** an executor. It cannot edit files, run commands, or
change session state. It only reads the turn transcript and delivers text advice.

## How it differs from the pi original

| Aspect | pi-omplike-advisor | Hermes plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Context model | Long-lived advisor agent with self-compaction | Stateless per-turn via `ctx.llm.complete()` |
| Turn detection | Native `turn_end` event | `post_llm_call` hook (fires once per turn, carries full history) |
| Advice delivery | `pi.sendMessage()` with steer + triggerTurn | `ctx.inject_message()` (CLI only) |
| Catch-up block | Stalls primary with exponential backoff while advisor settles | **Not available** — the plugin schedules review work after Hermes invokes its synchronous hook |
| Slash command | `/advisor on\|off\|status` | Same plus `/advisor model`, `/advisor provider`, `/advisor providers`, `/advisor models`, `/advisor test` |

The biggest difference: Hermes invokes plugin hooks synchronously. The advisor's
`post_llm_call` callback therefore does not call the second model directly. It
copies the completed turn into a one-worker background queue and returns. One
review may run and one newer turn may wait; if more completed turns arrive, the
queued turn is replaced by the newest one. This bounds hook latency, worker
count, memory use, and stale-review backlog.

The model call still has a 90-second timeout, but that timeout applies to the
background worker, not turn finalization. On process shutdown the plugin waits
at most one second for a fast in-flight review; the daemon worker is then
allowed to end with the process. Advice is injected when the review completes.
The hold-and-reconfirm pattern means concerns are never delivered on first
emission, only after a later review raises the same normalized note again.

## Installation

The plugin ships with Hermes Agent. Enable it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - advisor
```

Or at runtime: `/advisor on`

### Prerequisites

- A Hermes build with `PluginContext.request_model_selection` (included with
  the in-tree advisor plugin), plus `ctx.register_hook`, `ctx.llm.complete`, and
  `ctx.register_command`
- A Hermes profile with at least one LLM provider configured

## Configuration

### Trust gate for provider/model overrides

If you set a different model or provider for the advisor via `/advisor model`
or `/advisor provider`, Hermes' PluginLlm trust gate will block the override
unless you add:

```yaml
plugins:
  entries:
    advisor:
      llm:
        allow_provider_override: true
        allow_model_override: true
```

Without this, `ctx.llm.complete()` raises `PluginLlmTrustError` and the advisor
silently produces no output. The error is logged but not visible to the user.

`/advisor model`, `/advisor provider`, and the interactive selector check this
config when an override is set and print a reminder naming the exact flags
still missing, so the silent-failure mode is surfaced at the point of cause.

If the advisor inherits the primary model (no `/advisor model` or
`/advisor provider` set), no trust gate config is needed.

The trust gate is resolved per-call, so config changes take effect on the next
turn without restarting.

### Advisor model

By default, the advisor uses the same model as the main agent. Override at
runtime:

```
/advisor model                      # interactive selector: pick provider + model
/advisor model mimo-v2.5            # different model, same provider (direct name)
/advisor provider custom:opencode-go  # different provider
/advisor config model deepseek-v4-pro  # alias for /advisor model
/advisor config provider custom:deepseek
```

**Interactive selector** (`/advisor model` with no arguments): opens the same
prompt_toolkit-native provider+model modal that `/model` uses. Select a
provider, then a model — the result is applied to the advisor's override while
your primary model config stays untouched.

It does not spawn a subprocess, take over the terminal, or write and restore the
primary `model.*` configuration. The selected provider/model pair is returned
to the plugin callback and stored only in advisor state. This path is shared on
macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Model and provider are independently settable. Set only `model` to use a
different model on the same provider. Set both to route to a completely
different provider and auth.

Check what's available — both listings use the same provider/model source as
the interactive picker:

```
/advisor providers           # list configured providers
/advisor models openrouter   # list models for a provider
/advisor status              # show current config
```

Model/provider settings persist in `$HERMES_HOME/advisor/state.json`, scoped to
the active profile. Held concerns and blockers are stored under
`$HERMES_HOME/advisor/sessions/`, scoped to the conversation. Existing
package-local settings are read once and migrated.

**A pairing that works well:** keep the primary agent on your usual coding
model and point the advisor at a fast mid-sized model from a provider you
already have credentials for — e.g. `/advisor model <fast-model>` after
configuring that provider in Hermes. A cheap, quick second opinion on every
turn catches more than an expensive one that lags the conversation.

### Project guidance (WATCHDOG.md)

If a `WATCHDOG.md` file exists in the working directory, its contents are
appended to the advisor's system prompt as advisor-only review guidance. This
lets you tune what the advisor watches for — project-specific traps, style
rules, recurring pitfalls — without touching the main agent's prompt.

## Usage

```
/advisor          — show status
/advisor on       — enable automatic per-turn review
/advisor off      — disable (persisted)
/advisor status   — current state, model, provider, held notes
/advisor model <name>     — set advisor model
/advisor provider <name>  — set advisor provider
/advisor config           — same as /advisor status
/advisor config model <name>     — same as /advisor model
/advisor config provider <name>  — same as /advisor provider
/advisor providers        — list configured providers
/advisor models <provider> — list models for a provider
/advisor test <severity> <note>  — inject a test advisory (for testing delivery)
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ADVISOR_NO_REVIEW=1` | Diagnostic/test escape hatch — not a user setting (behaviour belongs in `config.yaml`). Skips live model reviews while keeping the `/advisor test` delivery path for manual testing. |

## Caveats

- **No advice-to-advice loops.** Delivered advice is injected as a user
  message, which starts an automatic follow-up turn — and a turn whose user
  message is the advisor's own injected review (it starts with
  `◆ Advisor review`) is never reviewed again. Without that cut, a held
  concern the agent keeps failing to address could chain
  advice → auto-turn → review → advice indefinitely with no user in the loop.
- **`inject_message` is CLI only.** On Telegram, Discord, or other gateway
  platforms, deliverable advice is logged but not injected into the
  conversation. Held concerns remain visible through `/advisor status`.
- **No catch-up block.** The hook schedules review work and immediately returns.
  Advice is injected whenever the background review completes. If Hermes exits
  while a review is still running after the one-second shutdown grace period,
  that in-flight result is abandoned.
- **`post_llm_call` fires once per turn at completion.** The advisor never sees
  intermediate thinking or mid-turn tool call results until the turn is fully
  done. For live mid-turn hints, `post_tool_call` would be needed (not implemented).
- **Plugin code changes require a full Hermes restart.** `/new` is not enough.
- **`plugins.enabled` must be a YAML list.** A scalar value like
  `plugins.enabled: advisor` silently fails. Use:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    enabled:
      - advisor
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Advisor stuck on an old issue

If the advisor keeps flagging something you've already addressed (like a stale
`[BLOCKER]` or `[CONCERN]` that won't clear), the held notes need resetting.
Do the "IT Crowd" fixit:

```
/advisor off
/advisor on
```

This clears all held notes and starts fresh. Concerns and blockers are stored in
`$HERMES_HOME/advisor/sessions/` and survive agent restarts, so stale items can
accumulate across sessions. The toggle is the surest reset.
