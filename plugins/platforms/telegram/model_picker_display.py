"""Display-only shaping for Bedrock IDs in the Telegram ``/model`` picker.

Bedrock advertises the same model several times: as a plain foundation-model ID
(``anthropic.claude-opus-5``) and behind one or more routing namespaces
(``us.``, ``global.``, ...). Rendered raw in a two-column inline keyboard those
IDs truncate to indistinguishable buttons, which makes picking a specific model
guesswork rather than a choice (issue #94986).

Pure functions on purpose — no Telegram objects, no adapter state — so the
display contract is testable without a bot. **Model IDs are never rewritten**:
callers select through positional indices into their own list, so the exact ID
the provider advertised is what reaches Bedrock.
