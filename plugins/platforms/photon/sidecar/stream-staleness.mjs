// Pure decision helpers for the zombie-stream (half-open gRPC) watchdog.
//
// spectrum-ts only reconnects when its inbound async iterator throws or ends.
// A half-open ("zombie") socket makes the iterator hang forever — no error,
// no end — so inbound silently dies while /healthz still looks fine. The
// watchdog in index.mjs tracks the last time the inbound iterator yielded and,
// once the stream has been silent past a conservative threshold, drives a
// cheap authenticated unary read over the same channel. STRICT semantics:
//
//   - probe resolves, or rejects with a not-found-shaped error for our
//     synthetic id            -> ALIVE (the wire round-tripped)
//   - probe rejects with a server-answered error — gRPC INVALID_ARGUMENT,
//     or a message stamped with a spectrum component source like
//     "[spectrum-imessage] ..." -> ALIVE (a server-side answer also proves
//     the wire round-tripped; the synthetic probe id is not a valid Apple
//     message GUID, so the proxy rejects it with a validation error on
//     every probe — #101618)
//   - probe rejects any other way (UNAVAILABLE, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, network
//     down, ...)              -> INCONCLUSIVE — never treated as alive, and
//                                never treated as zombie-proof either
//
// A zombie is only declared when the stream is silent past the threshold AND
// a probe proves connectivity (the wire works but the stream is deaf). Silence
// alone NEVER degrades the stream: shared lines can be legitimately quiet for
// hours. Inconclusive probes NEVER degrade it either: the network may simply
// be down, and in that case the iterator will eventually throw and the
// existing re-subscribe loop recovers on its own.
//
// These helpers are pure (no SDK, no timers) so tests can execute them under
// node — see tests/plugins/platforms/photon/test_zombie_stream_watchdog.py.
