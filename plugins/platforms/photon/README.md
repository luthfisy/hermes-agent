# Photon iMessage platform plugin

This plugin connects Hermes Agent to iMessage (and other Spectrum
interfaces) through [Photon][photon] — a managed service that handles
iMessage line allocation, delivery, and abuse-prevention so users don't
have to run their own Mac relay.

The free tier uses Photon's shared iMessage line pool and is the path we
recommend for everyone who doesn't already pay for a dedicated number.

## Architecture

Like Discord and Slack, Photon is a **persistent-connection** channel — no
public URL, no webhook, no signing secret. The `spectrum-ts` SDK holds a
long-lived **gRPC stream** to Photon for both directions. Because the SDK is
TypeScript-only, Hermes runs it inside a small supervised Node sidecar and
talks to it over loopback.

```
                         gRPC (spectrum-ts)
┌─────────────────────────┐ ◄───────────────► ┌──────────────────────┐
│  Photon Spectrum cloud  │   app.messages    │  Node sidecar        │
│  (iMessage line owner)  │   space.send()    │  (plugins/…/sidecar) │
└─────────────────────────┘                   └──────────┬───────────┘
                                       GET /inbound (NDJSON) │  ▲ POST /send
                                       inbound events        ▼  │ /send-richlink
                                                            │  │ /typing
                                              ┌──────────────────────┐
                                              │  PhotonAdapter        │
                                              │  (Python, in gateway) │
                                              └──────────────────────┘
```

- **Inbound**: the sidecar consumes the SDK's `app.messages` gRPC stream,
  normalizes each message, and streams it to the adapter over a loopback
  `GET /inbound` (NDJSON). The adapter dedupes on `messageId` and dispatches
  a `MessageEvent` to the gateway. It reconnects automatically if the stream
  drops; the sidecar owns the gRPC reconnect to Photon.
- **Outbound**: `send` / `send_typing` / reaction tapbacks are loopback POSTs
  to the sidecar (`/send`, `/send-richlink`, `/send-attachment`, `/typing`,
  `/react`, `/unreact`), authenticated with a shared
  `X-Hermes-Sidecar-Token`.

## First-time setup

```bash
# One-shot setup: device login (opens browser) + project + user + sidecar deps
hermes photon setup --phone +15551234567

# Start the gateway
hermes gateway start
```

`hermes photon setup` does, in order:

1. **Device login** (RFC 8628, `client_id=photon-cli`) — opens
   `https://app.photon.codes/` for approval and stores the bearer token.
2. **Find or create** the `Hermes Agent` project on the Photon dashboard.
3. **Provision the project secret** — mint a fresh project secret (the
   dashboard reveals it only once) and persist it to `~/.hermes/.env` so the
   sidecar can authenticate `spectrum-ts`. Spectrum is always on, so there's no
   separate enable step.
4. **Register your phone number** as a Spectrum user (idempotent — skipped if
   a user with that number already exists).
5. **Print the assigned iMessage line** — the number you text to reach your
   agent.
6. **Install the sidecar deps** (`npm ci` — installs the committed lockfile
   verbatim, so every setup runs the exact `spectrum-ts` version this plugin
   was written against).

There is no separate `login` command; like every other Hermes channel,
onboarding goes through one setup surface. Re-running `setup` reuses an
existing token/project, so it's safe to run again to finish a partial setup.
Run `hermes photon status` to see what's configured.

## Credentials

Runtime SDK credentials live in `~/.hermes/.env` (the same place every other
channel keeps its token), and the adapter reads them from the environment:

```bash
PHOTON_PROJECT_ID=<projectId>   # the SDK's projectId (same as the dashboard project id)
PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET=<projectSecret>
```

Management metadata lives in `~/.hermes/auth.json` under `credential_pool`:

```jsonc
{
  "credential_pool": {
    "photon": [
      { "access_token": "<device-bearer>", "issued_at": ... }
    ],
    "photon_project": [
      {
        "dashboard_project_id": "<project id>",
        "spectrum_project_id": "<project id>",
        "project_secret": "<projectSecret>",
        "name": "Hermes Agent"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note on ids.** A Photon project's dashboard id and its Spectrum project id
> are the same value, exposed as `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID`. The `dashboard_project_id`
> and `spectrum_project_id` keys in `auth.json` both hold that id.

## Configuration knobs

All env vars are documented in `plugin.yaml`. The most important:

| Env var                   | Default                    | Meaning                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID`       | from .env / auth.json      | Spectrum project id (SDK `projectId`)|
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET`   | from .env / auth.json      | Project secret                       |
| `PHOTON_SIDECAR_PORT`     | 8789                       | Loopback port for the sidecar        |
| `PHOTON_SIDECAR_AUTOSTART`| true                       | Spawn the sidecar on connect         |
| `PHOTON_DASHBOARD_HOST`   | https://app.photon.codes   | Dashboard API host                   |
| `PHOTON_SPECTRUM_HOST`    | https://spectrum.photon.codes | Spectrum API host                 |
| `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL`     | your number (set by setup) | Default space for cron delivery — a space id, or a bare E.164 number (resolved to a DM) |
| `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS`    | your number (set by setup) | Comma-separated E.164 allowlist      |
| `PHOTON_REQUIRE_MENTION`  | false                      | Gate group chats on a wake word      |
| `PHOTON_MAX_INLINE_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` | 20 MB           | Max inbound attachment size the sidecar reads & inlines |
| `PHOTON_TELEMETRY`        | false                      | Spectrum SDK telemetry — toggle with `hermes photon telemetry on\|off` (restart the gateway to apply) |
| `PHOTON_MARKDOWN`         | true                       | Send agent replies as markdown (iMessage renders natively). `false` strips formatting to plain text |
| `PHOTON_REACTIONS`        | false                      | Tapback 👀/👍/👎 as processing status; tapbacks on bot messages reach the agent as `reaction:added:<emoji>` |

Behavioral settings live in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Set
`photon.imessage_mode: local` to use Spectrum's open-source macOS Messages
path; the adapter exports `PHOTON_IMESSAGE_MODE` only to the sidecar process.
The unified `hermes gateway setup` wizard exposes both modes. Local setup does
not use Spectrum project credentials; the Mac must be signed into Messages,
and the process that starts Hermes may need Full Disk Access to read
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`.

## Attachments & limitations

- **Inbound attachments and voice notes are downloaded.** The sidecar reads
  the bytes (`content.read()`) and base64-inlines them on the NDJSON event; the
  adapter caches them to the shared media cache and populates `media_urls` /
  `media_types`, so the agent sees the real image/file or can transcribe the
  voice note — parity with the BlueBubbles iMessage channel. Mixed iMessage
  bubbles that contain both text and attachments are normalized as a grouped
  payload so the user's typed text is preserved alongside the cached media.
  Media larger than `PHOTON_MAX_INLINE_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` (default 20 MB), or
  any byte read that fails, falls back to a text marker (`[Photon attachment
  received: …]` or `[Photon voice received: …]`) so the agent still knows
  something arrived. If Spectrum emits a `richlink` content object, Hermes
  preserves its URL plus any title/summary metadata Spectrum already exposed;
  current Spectrum versions may still deliver ordinary inbound links as plain
  `text`. iMessage may also emit rich-link preview artwork as
  `.pluginPayloadAttachment` images immediately after the URL; Hermes coalesces
  those artifacts so the agent receives one link message instead of a follow-up
  `(attachment)` prompt.
- **Outbound attachments are supported.** Images, voice notes, video, and
  documents are sent via `space.send(attachment(...))` /
  `space.send(voice(...))` through the sidecar's `/send-attachment`
  endpoint; a caption is delivered as a separate text bubble after the media.
- **Markdown is rendered.** Replies go out via spectrum-ts' `markdown()`
  builder; iMessage renders bold/italics/lists/code natively and other
  Spectrum platforms degrade to readable plain text. URL-only replies go out
  via spectrum-ts' `richlink()` builder so iMessage can render a native link
  preview card. `PHOTON_MARKDOWN=false` reverts to stripped plain text and
  disables rich-link routing.
- **Reactions (tapbacks) are supported** behind `PHOTON_REACTIONS` (default
  off): the adapter tapbacks 👀 while processing and swaps it for 👍/👎 on
  completion, and a user tapback on a bot-sent message is routed to the agent
  as a synthetic `reaction:added:<emoji>` event. Removal after a sidecar
  restart is best-effort — the live reaction handle is lost, so a stale
  tapback heals when the next reaction replaces it. Group spaces stay
  reachable across restarts via spectrum-ts' `space.get(id)`. Hermes disables
  reactions in local mode because Spectrum 12.7 does not implement them there.
- **Local cold sends support DMs and existing groups.** Use a bare E.164 number
  to start a DM, or an existing chat GUID to rehydrate a group. Local mode
  cannot create a new group from a list of recipients.
- **Read receipts are supported in managed cloud mode.** The sidecar marks an
  inbound iMessage read after forwarding it to Hermes, so the sender sees
  `Read` without waiting for a model/tool turn. Inbound receipts for Hermes-sent
  messages are consumed as presence telemetry and never create an agent turn. Set
  `PHOTON_READ_RECEIPTS=false` to keep messages at `Delivered`. Spectrum 12.7
  does not implement marking messages read in local mode, so Hermes skips it.
- **Native polls are supported in managed cloud mode.** Hermes posts poll
  content through `spectrum-ts`' `poll(...)` builder via the sidecar's
  `/send-poll` endpoint. Local mode sends the normal numbered-choice clarify
  prompt instead.
- **Message effects are supported in managed cloud mode.** Text can be sent
  with native iMessage bubble/screen effects through `spectrum-ts`' iMessage
  `effect(...)` builder via the sidecar's `/send-effect` endpoint.
- **Local-mode capability limits (Spectrum 12.7).** Text/markdown, inbound and
  outbound attachments, DMs, incoming reply context, and existing groups work.
  Visible typing indicators, native outbound replies, editing/unsending,
  tapbacks, polls, effects, read receipts, new-group creation, and group member/
  metadata changes are not implemented by the local provider. Hermes avoids
  calling the unsupported presence/status operations and degrades clarify
  polls to numbered text.
- **Cron/standalone sends require a running gateway.** Processes outside
  the gateway (cron subprocesses, `hermes send`) cannot spawn the sidecar;
  they authenticate to the gateway's live sidecar via the runtime record at
  `<hermes-home>/runtime/photon-sidecar.json` (written after the sidecar's
  `/healthz` readiness check, `0600`, removed on stop/failed start). Also
  note that shared/free-tier Photon lines cannot INITIATE conversations
  with numbers that never texted the line — that's Photon-side policy, not
  a Hermes limitation.

## Upgrading spectrum-ts

`spectrum-ts` is pinned to an **exact version** in `sidecar/package.json`
(no `^` range) and installed with `npm ci`, because the SDK ships breaking
majors (v2 removed `defineFusorPlatform`; v3 reworked space construction; v5
split it into `@spectrum-ts/*` packages, with `spectrum-ts` as the umbrella
that re-exports them; v8 made `richlink` primarily outbound, so many inbound
links now arrive as plain `text`). A floating range or `npm install spectrum-ts@latest`
would let a breaking release take down fresh setups silently. Upgrades are
deliberate:

1. Read the [SDK release notes](https://github.com/photon-hq/spectrum-ts/releases)
   for every version between the current pin and the target.
2. Bump the exact pin in `sidecar/package.json`, then run `npm install`
   inside `sidecar/` to regenerate `package-lock.json`. Commit both.
3. Migrate `sidecar/spectrum-runtime.mjs` against the new typings. The sidecar
   imports framework primitives from `@spectrum-ts/core`, managed iMessage from
   `spectrum-ts/providers/imessage`, and local macOS iMessage from
   `@spectrum-ts/imessage-local`.
4. Run `npm test` in `sidecar/`. The tests verify installed provider exports,
   executable local/cloud selection, and native mixed-message ordering through
   both real Spectrum provider pipelines. `npm run smoke:spectrum` runs only
   that compatibility check.
5. Run `pytest tests/plugins/platforms/photon/`.
6. Verify end-to-end: `hermes photon status`, a DM and a group roundtrip,
   and an agent reply into a group right after a gateway restart (exercises
   `space.get` rehydration).
