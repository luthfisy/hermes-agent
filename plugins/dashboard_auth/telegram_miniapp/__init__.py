"""TelegramMiniAppProvider — dashboard auth for the Telegram Mini App (spec §1-§4).

Exposes the local Hermes dashboard inside a Telegram Mini App. The frontend
sends Telegram's signed ``initData`` string as the bearer credential
(``Authorization: Bearer <initData>`` — see ``initdata.py``'s module
docstring for the spec §8 caveat on this transport assumption);
``verify_token`` HMAC-verifies it against ``TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN``, extracts
the Telegram user id, and resolves it to one of the tiers in ``tiers.py``
(unauthorized / paired / admin) using the exact same pairing/allowlist
decision the Telegram bot itself uses for DM traffic — not a parallel
authorization system.

Non-goals (do not reintroduce — see the spec this plugin implements):
  * No Chat/PTY-over-WebSocket exposure through the Mini App.
  * No per-message sender attribution.
  * No "fixing" cross-profile authorization into being profile-aware —
    ``PairingStore`` and the env allowlists this defers to
    (``gateway.authz_mixin.is_authorized``) are process-global by design,
    same as for every other platform; a multi-profile Hermes instance has
    ONE pairing/allowlist surface, not one per profile.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Route registration (spec §1/§4: read-only status/skills/cron + own DM
# sessions). Deliberately a short, explicit allowlist — NOT a blanket prefix
# on /api/sessions/. `token_auth.is_token_route()` has no HTTP-method
# awareness, so a bare `match="prefix"` registration of "/api/sessions/"
# would also make POST /api/sessions/bulk-delete, POST /api/sessions/prune,
# and the broad-read GET /api/sessions/search, /stats, /empty/count
# token-authable — none of which this plugin intends to expose. Session ids
# are registered with `match="regex"` instead. This used to be anchored to
# an enumerated set of known id shapes so a literal sibling path could never
# satisfy the pattern "by construction" -- abandoned once api_server-sourced
# sessions (gateway/platforms/api_server.py) turned out to accept a
# caller-supplied id verbatim, an open set no enumeration can ever close
# (see _SESSION_ID_SHAPE's own comment below). The regex now matches any
# single path segment and explicitly excludes the known sibling literals
# instead -- exclusion, not construction, is what keeps them out.
#
# READ-ONLY (methods=("GET","HEAD")): this is the spec §1 read-only guarantee,
# and it is load-bearing for safety, not cosmetic. Path matching is method-
# blind, and several of these paths ALSO mount a mutating handler on the exact
# same path — GET vs POST /api/skills (create-skill, which is agent-executed,
# i.e. code execution), GET vs PUT /api/skills/content, GET vs POST
# /api/cron/jobs, GET vs DELETE/PATCH /api/sessions/{id}. Registering these
# for token auth WITHOUT the method restriction would make a paired Mini App
# principal able to authenticate those write verbs too (the token seam would
# set token_authenticated=True and the cookie gate would then skip), turning a
# "read-only" tier into full write + RCE. Restricting to the read verbs means
# the seam never authenticates a write request here; a write attempt falls
# through to the cookie gate and is rejected for a caller with no cookie.
#
# This registers DISPATCH eligibility only — "a token could plausibly
# authenticate here" — not authorization. The DM-ownership check on
# GET /api/sessions/{id} and .../messages (ensuring the requester only sees
# their own sessions) is enforced separately in the route handlers.
#
# All registrations use required=False: every one of these routes is also
# reachable today by the existing cookie-authenticated desktop dashboard.
# required=True (the default) would make this seam token-EXCLUSIVE for the
# path — a desktop request with no Authorization header would get a hard 401
# from this seam and never reach the cookie gate, locking out the actual
# dashboard operator the day this plugin is enabled. required=False means a
# request with no bearer token at all is untouched by this seam and falls
# through to the cookie gate exactly as before; a request that DOES present
# a bearer token (e.g. the Mini App) is still fully authenticated/rejected
# by this seam alone, unchanged from required=True's contract for a
# token-bearing caller. See token_auth.py's module + register_token_route
# docstrings for the full design.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Session ids are NOT a closed set of shapes. Started out as an enumerated
# allowlist (interactive "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_hex" ids, then cron's
# "cron_{job_id}_{timestamp}" added after cron-sourced sessions 401'd the
# same way -- see git history), but gateway/platforms/api_server.py's
# create_session accepts a CALLER-SUPPLIED id verbatim (only checked for
# length and unsafe characters, `_is_path_unsafe` -- no shape constraint at
# all) alongside its own two fallback shapes ("api_{ts}_{hex8}" and a bare
# uuid4()). An api_server-sourced session with a real uuid4 id 401'd the
# same way cron ids used to, misread by the Mini App as "session expired"
# (api.ts treats any post-establishment 401 as auth expiry) -- and no finite
# enumeration can ever close this for api_server, since an external caller
# can pass literally any safe string as its id.
#
# So this matches ANY single path segment except the known literal sibling
# routes under /api/sessions/ (search, stats, empty, bulk-delete, prune --
# see the module comment above on why a blanket prefix isn't used instead).
# Multi-segment siblings (empty/count) can never fullmatch a single-segment
# pattern regardless, so they don't need excluding. This regex is DISPATCH
# eligibility only, same as everywhere else in this module -- the excluded
# names don't need to be exhaustive for *security* (each of those routes
