"""Regression tests for install.sh path quoting (issue #40820).

When the user's ``$HOME`` (and therefore ``$HERMES_HOME``) lives under a path
containing spaces — e.g. an external drive mounted at
``/Volumes/External Disk/Users/<name>`` — bare command-position expansions of
the managed tool paths (``$UV_CMD`` = ``$HERMES_HOME/bin/uv``,
``$HERMES_CMD`` = the installed hermes launcher) word-split and the installer
fails at the ``python-deps``/``venv`` stage with
``/Volumes/External: No such file or directory``.

Every command-position use of these variables must be double-quoted.
