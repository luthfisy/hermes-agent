# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Board-targeted decomposition (regression pin for the decomposer board-
# routing gap: decomposed children used to inherit the parent's board, so a
# cover card for an unwatched/exempted board landed there — invisible to
# every watcher).
#
# A board is not a column — it is the DB file a row lives in. Targeting a
# board at decompose time creates the children and their links (including
# the root-wait edges) in the TARGET board's DB while the root stays on its
# own board, deliberately in ``triage``: flipping it to ``todo`` there would
# gate it by links the parent board's sweep cannot see, while the target
# board's sweep cannot see the root's row at all — either way the promotion
# graph corrupts or a zombie orchestrator gets dispatched (both proven live
# during development). A ``triage`` root is not dispatchable and not
# sweep-eligible, so the hazard is closed by construction; a repeat
# decompose of the still-triage root is an idempotent no-op. Omitting the
# argument preserves the parent-board behavior.
