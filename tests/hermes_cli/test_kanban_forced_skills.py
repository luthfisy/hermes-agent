"""Forced skills on a Kanban card are validated against the profile that will run it.

A card's ``--skill`` / ``skills=[...]`` names are handed to the worker as
``hermes --skills <name>``. Nothing downstream treats an unresolvable name as an
error: ``build_preloaded_skills_prompt`` reports it *missing* and the worker runs
anyway, without the specialist context the card exists to pin. The failure is
therefore invisible until someone reads the run log, and it costs a full worker
attempt every time.

These are contract tests for the shared pre-queue validation: it runs for every
creation surface (CLI and model tool alike), it resolves names against the
ASSIGNEE's profile rather than the creator's, and it rejects a bad list whole.
