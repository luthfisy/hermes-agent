"""`kanban block` requires a reason, like `kanban_block` always has.

A blocked task is a request for a human decision, and a request with no sentence
is one nobody can act on. The worker tool (tools/kanban_tools.py `_handle_block`)
has always refused an empty reason with "reason is required — explain what input
you need"; the CLI accepted one, so the requirement depended on which surface you
used.

Measured on one install: 126 of 141 `blocked` events carried a reason, and 13 of
the 15 that did not came from outside any run — this path.
