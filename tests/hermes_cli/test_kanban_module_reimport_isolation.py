"""Re-importing the Hermes modules must not outlive the test that asked for it.

A handful of kanban tests need a fresh ``HERMES_HOME`` to be read at *import*
time, so they drop ``hermes_cli`` from ``sys.modules`` and import it again.
Dropping the entries and walking away leaves two copies of the same code alive
for the rest of the session: the one every already-imported test module holds,
and the one ``sys.modules`` hands to the next importer.

That split has teeth. ``_kanban_write_guard`` in ``tests/conftest.py`` patches
``connect`` on the ``hermes_cli.kanban_db_connect`` copy it finds in
``sys.modules``, so a test module whose global still points at the other copy
calls an UNGUARDED ``connect``: the
deny-list that keeps the suite off the operator's real ``~/.hermes`` (#69283)
stops working, and says nothing about it. It also lets a test observe a
module-level registry on one copy while the code under test mutates the other,
which is what made a dozen hook and lifecycle tests fail in a full run and pass
one file at a time.

These tests pin the restore that ``fresh_hermes_modules`` performs.
