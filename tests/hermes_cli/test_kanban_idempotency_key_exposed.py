"""``idempotency_key`` must survive the trip back out through the CLI.

Automation that files a task under a dedup key needs to recognise that task
later — to notice it is already open, to comment on it, to decide whether to
file again. ``create`` returns an id but never says whether it deduped, and
every other lookup is by id, so without the key on the way out the only
available handle is ``title``. That is not a key: a human editing the title
detaches the automation from its own task, silently.
