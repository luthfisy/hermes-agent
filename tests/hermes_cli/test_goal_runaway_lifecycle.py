"""Root-cause regression tests for the Goal runaway-completion lifecycle.

Two defects this file guards against (both observed on a live desktop session):

1. **Stale-pause resurrection.** ``GoalManager.evaluate_after_turn`` loads the goal once and
   mutates that in-memory snapshot; a slow judge call (10-40s) runs while the user pauses the
   goal from the Desktop control surface. The turn's final ``_save()`` is a whole-object write
   that overwrites the freshly-persisted ``paused`` back to ``active`` — the goal "resumes"
   itself and keeps dispatching continuations even though the user asked for it to stop.

2. **Judge sees only the last response, not cumulative evidence.** The strict subgoal judge is
   told to require concrete evidence (a file excerpt, an output line, a command result) for a
   criterion to count, but ``evaluate_after_turn``/``judge_goal`` only forward the last
   assistant text. When an already-complete goal (e.g. count reached 25, ``count_state.json``
   written) is re-judged, the judge can't see the tool result and keeps returning CONTINUE, so
   the loop re-dispatches forever ("Done — goal complete." repeated 20x). The judge must be
   handed the turn's concrete evidence, not just the final prose.
