"""Tests for hermes -z -w — worktree isolation in one-shot mode (#67458).

The flag was previously accepted but silently ignored: run_oneshot() never
received it, so the agent ran in the current checkout and its commits landed
on the live branch. These tests pin the forwarded behavior: TERMINAL_CWD is
retargeted at the disposable worktree for the duration of the run, cleanup
runs afterward, and a requested-but-failed setup refuses to run instead of
silently dropping isolation.
