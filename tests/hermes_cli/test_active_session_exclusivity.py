"""Per-session exclusivity in the active-session registry.

The property under test is a correctness one, and it is separate from capacity:
AT MOST ONE LIVE OWNER MAY RUN A GIVEN STORED SESSION, whether or not an
operator configured ``max_concurrent_sessions``.

It matters because a second owner does not merely duplicate work. It loads its
own snapshot of the transcript, reasons from a history that does not include the
first owner's in-flight turn, and then appends to the same stored session -- so
the conversation ends up containing two replies that never saw each other. That
was observed in practice before this fence existed: two gateway processes
resumed one stored session, neither was refused, and both wrote to it.

The old behaviour is worth stating precisely, because it looked deliberate: with
no cap configured, ``try_acquire_active_session`` returned a disabled no-op lease
and never touched the registry at all. Capacity being unconfigured was silently
treated as "concurrent writers to one session are fine", which it never is.
