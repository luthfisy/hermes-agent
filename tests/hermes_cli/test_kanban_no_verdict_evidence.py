"""A retry after a no-verdict exit is told what the previous run left behind.

`detect_crashed_workers` records a clean-exit-without-verdict as a protocol
violation and surfaces the corrective sentence to the retry worker: "if the prior
run already did the work, verify it and report the result via kanban_complete".
Verifying it began with REDISCOVERING it — nothing handed the retry what the last
run had changed, so every attempt re-derived the same state.

Measured on one install: 117 such runs across 49 tasks, 5.0 runs per task, and 4
tasks that never recovered.
