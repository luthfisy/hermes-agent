"""Process-destruction spellings on the unconditional hardline floor.

The floor below yolo is only worth the spellings it recognizes, and the two
process rules each recognized exactly one:

* the fork bomb rule matched a function literally NAMED ``:``, so renaming it
  (``bomb(){ bomb|bomb& };bomb``) — same bomb, same fork storm — ran under
  ``--yolo`` / ``approvals.mode: off`` with no prompt at all, and so did the
  canonical bomb written with a ``;`` before the closing brace;
* the kill rule read every flag as a single token, so a signal handed over as
  a SEPARATE token (``kill -s KILL -1``) walked straight past it, and
  ``killall5`` — whose entire job is signalling every process on the host —
  was not covered at all.

The same kill rule fired on ``-1`` wherever it appeared, so ``kill -1 1234``
(signal 1 is SIGHUP: the ordinary "tell the daemon to reload" idiom) was
hardline-blocked. The floor cannot be approved, so that command could not be
run at all — while ``kill -HUP 1234``, the exact same syscall, was fine.
