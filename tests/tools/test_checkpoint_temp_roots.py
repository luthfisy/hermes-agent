"""A checkpoint project must never be a directory whose snapshot cannot succeed.

Two related failure modes repeat on every turn and turned into a standing health alert:

* the temp root itself becomes a project — anything written under ``/tmp`` without a project
  marker of its own resolves to ``/tmp`` (see ``get_working_dir_for_path``), so the store
  starts ingesting browser caches and root-owned system residue;
* a workdir that *contains* root-owned temp residue aborts ``git add -A`` with
  ``fatal: 添加文件失败`` / exit 128, because the agent user cannot read those entries.  The
  snapshot never succeeds, so the error repeats until the store is manually cleared.

Invariants asserted here: temp roots are never snapshot targets, their children still are,
and a workdir holding unreadable residue checkpoints cleanly.
