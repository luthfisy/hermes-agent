"""Behaviour contract for an unresolvable TTS provider.

A provider name that is neither a built-in engine nor claimed by a plugin used to
be answered with Edge audio while the configured name was still reported, so the
log read ``provider: gcloud-tts`` over an Edge render and the only way to notice
was to recognise the wrong voice.

Two things must hold when that substitution happens: it is announced, and the
reported provider names the engine that actually spoke.
