"""Background verification runs must reach the evidence ledger.

``record_terminal_result()`` has exactly one production call site
(``tools/terminal_tool.py``), and it sits on the FOREGROUND completion path.
A ``background=True`` spawn returns early with a synthetic ``exit_code: 0``
while the command is still running, so it never reaches that site.

The consequence is not cosmetic. Any suite too slow for the foreground timeout
*must* run in the background, therefore can never record evidence, so
``verification_status()`` keeps returning ``stale`` (``last_edit_at`` stays
newer than the last recorded event) and the verify-on-stop nudge replays an
older foreground run forever — quoting test counts that no longer exist.

These tests exercise the real registry against real short-lived processes. The
project's canonical verify command (``pnpm run test``) is resolved through a
PATH shim so the assertions are hermetic and never depend on a real pnpm.
