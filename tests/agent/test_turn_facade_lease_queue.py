"""Turn-lease starvation must queue an inbound delivery, never fail it (#84776, card t_d4f85953).

Reproduced in production: a turn that makes no model call and no tool completion still holds the
lease, and its transcript writes keep refreshing it. An inbound delivery (peer dm / bot-mode
delivery / peer run) that cannot take the lease inside its wait window is answered
``session_turn_lease_timeout`` and its message is dropped on the floor with no record anywhere.

The lease must not be stolen from a live holder, so the delivery is spooled into the existing
durable live-delivery store, pinned to the conversation instead of to a live-owner: the next turn
admitted on that conversation drains it as its first user message, exactly once.
