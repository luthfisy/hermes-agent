"""B-4: the no-progress guard must release the conversation, not only interrupt the turn.

A turn can wedge while its lease keeps being renewed, so the session stays owned by a turn that
will never finish: nothing else frees it and inbound deliveries are answered with a lease timeout
forever. The guard therefore has to do two things - hard-interrupt the turn, and stop renewing the
lease so the row expires and the next turn can take the conversation.
