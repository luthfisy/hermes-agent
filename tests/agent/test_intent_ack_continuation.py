"""Intent-ack continuation gate + detector behavior.

Covers the config-driven generalization of the codex intent-ack continuation
(issue #27881): the historical ``codex_responses``-only path is byte-stable
under the default ``"auto"`` mode, while an explicit ``true``/model-list opt-in
extends the "you announced an action but called no tool — keep going" nudge to
every api_mode and relaxes the codebase/workspace requirement so general
autonomous workflows ("I'll run a health check on the server") are caught.

These are invariant assertions about how the mode string and the detector
gates relate, not snapshots of the marker lists.
