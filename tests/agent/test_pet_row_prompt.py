"""Contract for the row prompt's one-character-per-region clause.

A prompt change has no observable behavior to assert, so this test pins the one
relationship the fix depends on: the population rule is ROW-scoped and
universal. It must appear in every animation-state row prompt (each row is a
strip of adjacent poses, where the model is tempted to draw a doubled figure)
and must stay out of the base-look prompt (a single centered mascot, where the
clause would say nothing useful).

If you rewrite the prompt text, keep those two properties and update the
markers here — that is the contract, not the exact sentence.
