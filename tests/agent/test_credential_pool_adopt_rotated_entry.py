"""Stale-agent-key recovery: adopt the pool's rotated token instead of
refreshing it or falling back.

Live incident 2026-09-19 03:16 PDT (``xai-oauth/grok-4.6`` → fallback to
``claude-opus-5``): a long-lived gateway session was built with access token
T1. xAI refresh tokens are single-use; another process consumed the refresh
token and the single ``device_code`` pool entry now held T2 (the same instant
a cron session was completing grok calls with T2). T1 got
``HTTP 403 unauthenticated:bad-credentials``. Recovery attributed the failure
to ``agent.api_key`` (T1), which matched no entry, so:

* ``try_refresh_matching(api_key_hint=T1)`` → ``None`` (nothing to refresh —
  correct, refreshing would burn the fresh single-use token), then
* ``mark_exhausted_and_rotate`` hit the single-entry escape and returned
  ``None`` on the premise that handing back the lone entry "does not change
  the credential" — false here, the entry holds T2 — so fallback fired while a
  perfectly valid token sat in the pool.

The fix adopts the lone entry when its ``runtime_api_key`` differs from the
failed key and is not itself expiring. Bounded by the existing
unmatched-rotation streak (#70401) and the caller's refresh-attempt cap.
