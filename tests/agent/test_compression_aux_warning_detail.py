"""The aux-provider compression warning must log WHY it fired.

``check_compression_model_feasibility`` computes a specific, actionable
message - either "configured provider 'X' is unavailable, reauthenticate" or
"no provider configured, run hermes setup" - stores it on the agent, emits it
to the user, and then logs a GENERIC line that carries neither.

That branch is the one where compression "will drop middle turns without a
summary", i.e. silent context loss. When it fires on a long-running gateway
the operator has only the log, and the log cannot distinguish a transient
auth failure on a configured provider (reauthenticate) from an unconfigured
install (run setup). Observed 21 times on a live install that HAD a provider
configured, with no way to tell which case it was.
