"""Live regression guardrail for the keepalive/transport bug class (#10933).

AlexKucera reported on Discord (2026-04-16) that after ``hermes update`` pulled
#10933, the FIRST chat in a session worked and EVERY subsequent chat failed
with ``APIConnectionError('Connection error.')`` whose cause was
``RuntimeError: Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed``.

The companion ``test_create_openai_client_reuse.py`` pins this contract at
object level with mocked ``OpenAI``. This file runs the same shape of
reproduction against a real provider so we have a true end-to-end smoke test
for any future keepalive / transport plumbing.

Opt-in — not part of default CI:
    HERMES_LIVE_TESTS=1 pytest tests/agent/test_sequential_chats_live.py -v

Requires ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` to be set (or sourced via ~/.hermes/.env).

# Load ~/.hermes/.env so live runs pick up OPENROUTER_API_KEY without
# needing the runner to shell-source it first. Silent if the file is absent.
#
# Only the key this module needs is imported, and only when live runs are
# actually enabled. The earlier version copied EVERY key from the file into
# os.environ at import time, which broke unrelated tests: pytest imports every
# collected module during COLLECTION, before any fixture runs, so the writes
# landed ahead of the hermetic `_hermetic_environment` autouse fixture and were
# never scrubbed. The file here carries 23 keys, ~12 of which (SEARXNG_URL,
# TELEGRAM_*, WHATSAPP_*, HERMES_SPOTIFY_*) do not match the conftest
# credential-suffix filter. With SEARXNG_URL leaked, `_get_backend()` resolved
# to "searxng" and two web-backend tests failed on `assert 'searxng' ==
# 'firecrawl'` — in any run that merely COLLECTED this file, with zero tests
# from it executing, which is why an execution-order bisect found nothing.
