"""The readiness poll must drain the started app's stdout while it polls.

Regression tests for a start command that logs more than the OS pipe buffer
holds before it binds its port. Nothing read that pipe until after teardown,
so the child blocked in ``write()``, never bound, and a healthy app was
reported as a readiness failure for the whole ``ready_timeout`` window.

These drive the real ``_run_start_phase`` against real subprocesses — the bug
lives in the interaction between an OS pipe and the poll loop, so a mocked
Popen cannot reproduce it.
