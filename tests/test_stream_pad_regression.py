"""Regression test for _STREAM_PAD — ensures streamed CLI output does not
trigger CommonMark's code-block rule (4+ leading spaces = <pre><code>).

Related: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/46557

Background
----------
The original `_STREAM_PAD` was hardcoded to 4 spaces, which meant every
streamed response line started with 4 leading spaces.  Per the CommonMark
spec, any text block with 4+ leading spaces is rendered as a code block.
This caused copied CLI output to render as ``<pre><code>`` in GitHub
issues, PR comments, and any other Markdown environment.

Upstream later removed the indent entirely (flush-left streaming +
native /copy). This regression test pins the invariant that matters:
the streamed-line prefix must never reach 4 leading spaces, whatever
the exact value is chosen (empty, 2, or configurable).
