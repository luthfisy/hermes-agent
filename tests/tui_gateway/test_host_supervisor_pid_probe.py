"""Regression guards for the compute-host supervisor's PID liveness probe.

``host_supervisor._pid_alive`` is called from read-only paths — most notably
``reconcile_startup_orphan``, which only wants to know whether a previously
registered compute host is still running.

On Windows ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` is NOT a no-op: CPython maps sig=0 to
``GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(0, pid)`` (bpo-14484), which broadcasts Ctrl+C to
the target's *entire console process group*. A status check that can kill the
process it is inspecting — plus unrelated siblings sharing its console — is
the failure mode these tests pin down.

Pattern per the windows-native-support reference / ``TestOwnerAlivePidProbe``
in ``tests/gateway/test_delivery_ledger.py``: patch
``gateway.status._pid_exists``, never ``os.kill``.

Note: ``time.monotonic`` is patched on the shared ``time`` module object
(``hs.time`` IS the stdlib module), so the clock stub is process-wide while the
test runs. It is restored by ``monkeypatch`` on teardown; the advancing
``itertools.count`` keeps _terminate_pid's wait loop bounded regardless of how
many times it is read.
