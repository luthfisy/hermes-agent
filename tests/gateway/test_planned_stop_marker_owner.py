"""Regression tests for issue #91212.

The CLI that *stops* a gateway writes ``.gateway-planned-stop.json`` so the gateway's shutdown
handler can classify the SIGTERM as operator-initiated (exit 0, ``gateway_state=stopped``) instead
of an unexpected exit (non-zero status, shutdown forensics, failure alerts). That stopper is routinely more privileged than
the gateway: ``sudo hermes gateway stop`` for a system unit whose ``User=`` is a login account, and
``docker exec`` into the container, where s6 runs as root while the gateway runs under
``s6-setuidgid hermes``. ``atomic_json_write`` creates the marker as its writer, so it landed
root:root 0600 inside a home owned by the gateway user — unreadable by the gateway, so the stop was
misclassified and the file stayed in ``~/.hermes`` forever (the reported symptom).

Two behaviour contracts are pinned here:

1. Hand-over: a privileged (euid 0) marker writer gives the file to the owner of the HERMES_HOME
   directory it lives in; unprivileged writers and root-owned homes chown nothing, and a failed
   chown is logged rather than turned into a write failure.
2. Reader-side diagnosis: a marker that exists but cannot be read by this uid says so in the log
   exactly once per path, so a misclassified stop is explainable after the fact.
