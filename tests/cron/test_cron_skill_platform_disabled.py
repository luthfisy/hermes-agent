"""Regression guard: a cron job's own skill list must not be filtered by ``skills.platform_disabled``.

The per-platform disabled list prunes the *interactive* skill surface: `/skills`, the agent's skill
toolset, and the slash-command gate all resolve the caller's platform and drop those skills. Cron
jobs declare their skills in the job definition instead, and the same job therefore behaves
differently depending on how it was launched:

* scheduled fire -> the run has no chat platform, ``platform_disabled`` resolves to nothing, the
  job's skills load;
* manual run triggered from a chat session -> the run inherits ``HERMES_SESSION_PLATFORM`` (e.g.
  ``feishu``), a skill that job depends on happens to be in ``platform_disabled['feishu']``, and
  ``_load_cron_skill_parts`` gets a "disabled" error back from ``skill_view`` — the job's playbook is
  silently replaced by "could not be found and were skipped" and the job degrades to running without
  its instructions.

Fix: ``skill_view(..., allow_platform_disabled=True)``, passed explicitly by
``cron/scheduler_prompt.py``. The default stays ``False``, so every interactive path is unchanged,
and the global ``skills.disabled`` list (a skill that was retired or removed) still blocks the
explicit load.

Covered here:
  T1 the interactive path (no flag) is still blocked by ``platform_disabled`` — the gate is not
     being widened for anyone else;
  T2 the explicit load (flag set) succeeds and really returns the playbook body;
  T3 global ``skills.disabled`` still wins over the flag;
  T4 end-to-end: ``_load_cron_skill_parts`` injects the playbook into the cron prompt and no longer
     emits the "skipped" notice;
  T5 the readiness preflight (``cron/scheduler_preflight._preflight_check_skills``) can still see
     the job's skill — it fails open on an unreadable skill, so the gate silently turned its
     missing-prerequisite check into a no-op.
