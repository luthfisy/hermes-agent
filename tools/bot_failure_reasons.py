"""Typed failure-reason codes for bot turns and relay replies.

A closed vocabulary of machine-readable reason codes carried ALONGSIDE the
free-text ``error`` fields (additive — old consumers keep working). Platform-side
codes are assigned by the transport/relay layer; agent-side codes are derived
from raw agent/provider error text via ``classify_agent_error``. Classifier
precedence is the order of ``_RULES``: auth outranks quota by design — real
provider 401 bodies (e.g. Anthropic) say "invalid, blocked or out of funds".
