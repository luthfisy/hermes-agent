"""The remote computer-use provider: a desktop on another machine, over MCP.

The agent dials out to a host bridge (see ``host_bridge.py``) running on the
machine whose keyboard and mouse should be driven. The bridge owns cua-driver,
its display, and its permissions; this side only needs the transport. That
inverts the deployment story of the built-in provider: a headless gateway
with no display and no cua-driver binary still gets the tool, because the
machine that matters is elsewhere.

Configuration — ``config.yaml``::

    computer_use:
      provider: remote
      remote:
        enabled: true          # optional; ``provider: remote`` implies intent
        url: https://host:8765/mcp   # bare host normalizes to /mcp

and a bearer token of at least 32 bytes in ``.env`` as
``HERMES_CUA_REMOTE_TOKEN``. Everything fails closed: unreadable config or a
missing/short token means no backend, never a quiet fall back to the local
desktop (``tools.computer_use.remote`` documents each rule).

``is_available`` is config-only by contract: it must be cheap and must not
touch the network, and it deliberately does not install or probe the local
cua-driver — the remote host owns the driver, so the local binary is
irrelevant to whether this provider can service calls.
