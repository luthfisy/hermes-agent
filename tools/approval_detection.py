# =========================================================================
# In-place edits of the Hermes security policy / credential files
# =========================================================================
#
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml holds approvals.mode, yolo, and the permanent
# allowlist; ~/.hermes/.env holds credentials.  Both are write-protected on
# the file_tools side, and the smart-approval adjudicator has approved a
# `sed -i` on config.yaml even while describing it correctly — so without a
# terminal-side floor the agent can rewrite its own guardrails.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a regex over the command text.  A text search
# gets both directions wrong, as the review of #60523 demonstrated:
#
#   * bypasses — `sed -e 's/a/b/' -i F` (the `i` is not in the first option
#     token), `command sed -i F`, `env -i sed -i F`, `/usr/bin/sed -i F`.
#     A pattern that hardcodes one spelling of the editor and one position
#     for `-i` misses every equivalent spelling.
#   * false positives — `sed -i 's|~/.hermes/config.yaml|config.yml|'
#     README.md` (the protected path is inside the sed PROGRAM, the target
#     is README.md) and `sed -i 's/a/b/' ~/.hermes/config.yaml.bak` (a
#     backup copy, not the policy file).  Searching for the path anywhere
#     after the options cannot tell an operand from program text.
#
# So resolve the command word for real, walk the editor's option grammar to
# decide whether in-place mode is actually on, and compare the resulting
# FILE OPERANDS against the protected paths as whole tokens.  Same
# reasoning as _WRITE_TARGET_BOUNDARY above, which already keeps
# `config.yaml.bak` out of the redirection deny.
#
# This runs its OWN wrapper resolution (_resolve_command_word below) rather
# than reusing _iter_shell_command_word_spans' _COMMAND_WRAPPER_WORDS table:
# that table is a best-effort heuristic for the softer execution-flag
# detection (unrecognized options are skipped and guessed past), which is
# the right tradeoff there but wrong for an unconditional floor — an
# unrecognized wrapper option must never silently misresolve which word is
# the editor. _resolve_command_word instead FAILS CLOSED (raises
# _WrapperResolutionFailed) on any option shape it does not recognize; see
# _unresolvable_segment_is_inplace_threat for how that exception is turned
# into a block rather than a silent pass-through.
#
# Out of scope on purpose (unchanged from the DANGEROUS/smart level, and
# matching how the xargs/find rm rules are drawn): indirect path delivery
# via xargs, find -exec, or shell variable expansion.  Those never name the
# target at a command position we can resolve statically.
#
# One precise instance of the same class: the `cd`-relative operand.
#   cd ~/.hermes && sed -i 's/a/b/' config.yaml
# After `cd` the relative operand `config.yaml` names the very same policy
# file, but the guard sees only the bare relative token — it has no `.hermes/`
# prefix and no CWD to resolve against, so whole-token matching cannot bind it
# to the protected file. Closing that would require tracking the `cd` target
# across the `&&` boundary (working-directory state), which is exactly the
# indirect-delivery class this guard deliberately does not model.

    Forgiving by design — this runs on adversarial and half-normalized text,

    actually pass ("~/.hermes/config.yaml" -> ~/.hermes/config.yaml), and a
    quoted sed program collapses to a single token, which is exactly how it
    reaches the editor.

    An unquoted ``<``/``>`` always ends the current word and starts its own
    token, even with no surrounding whitespace: the shell parses redirection
    that way, so `sed -i 's/a/b/' ~/.hermes/config.yaml>/tmp/out` hands sed
    the clean operand `~/.hermes/config.yaml` with the redirect target as a
    separate word. Without this, the two glued into one token that matched
    neither the protected path nor anything else, and the edit went
