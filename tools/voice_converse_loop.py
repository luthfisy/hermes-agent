"""Framework-agnostic off-device realtime voice loop primitives.

This is the neutral home of the VAD/STT/mic-shim core shared by every surface
that hosts a live "converse" WebSocket (the FastAPI dashboard router
:mod:`hermes_cli.web_routers._converse_loop` and the aiohttp gateway module
:mod:`gateway.platforms.api_server_converse`). Nothing here touches a socket, an
audio device, a live model or a specific web framework, so it can be unit-tested
in isolation.

Pieces:

* :class:`_NetworkMicStream` — a ``sounddevice``-shaped shim whose ``.read()``
  pulls int16 blocks from a thread-safe queue fed by a WebSocket. It lets the
  existing endpointer (:func:`tools.voice_mode._capture_until_quiet`) run
  unchanged against a network source instead of a local microphone.
* :class:`ConverseSession` — drives the reused VAD/STT loop on a worker thread:
  read 30 ms blocks, feed :class:`tools.voice_mode._BargeDetector`, and on a
  trip (speech onset) or silence endpoint capture the utterance, transcribe it
  and hand the transcript to the handler. It also owns the ``playing`` flag and
  barge-in (a trip while playing cuts TTS).
* :func:`split_text_for_tts_stream` — a provider-cap-aware sentence splitter, so
  a host that has no dashboard dependency can chunk a synthesized sentence
  without importing :mod:`hermes_cli.web_server_gateway`.

    stream out as they land), and speak the reply INCREMENTALLY — each sentence is
    synthesized and streamed the moment it is ready (``SentenceChunker`` +
    ``synth.synth`` → ``send_bytes``), so the user hears sentence 1 while sentence 2
    is still being generated. Control-frame order per turn is:
    ``transcript`` → (``speaking`` + PCM frames) → optional ``interrupted``/``error``
    → ``turn_done``.

    The host adapts by passing:

    * ``send_json`` / ``send_bytes`` — awaitables wrapping the host ws (aiohttp and
      starlette both expose async ``send_json``/``send_bytes``, so a host can pass
      ``ws.send_json``/``ws.send_bytes`` directly).
    * ``run_turn(transcript, on_delta, *, interrupted) -> (reply_text, err)`` — runs
      one agent turn, calling ``on_delta`` with streaming text, and returns the reply
      text (for history) and an error string (or ``None``). The driver awaits it as a
      task and owns closing the synthesis pipeline when it ends.
    * ``synth`` — a converse synthesizer (``.sample_rate`` + ``.synth(text) ->
      Iterator[bytes]``); ``cap`` — the provider's max text length.
    * ``history`` — the mutable conversation-history list; the driver appends the
